Hmm, where does one begin with this? I've had a regular and ongoing relationship with psychedelic substances for the past 20 years, and while Alan Watts wasn't wrong (more on this later) I am firmly in the McKenna school of thought:

> We are a sick species, and we need constant recourse to medication.

There is much to be faulted in the modern way of psychedelic engagement, detailed well in Daniel Pinchbeck's book 'Breaking Open the Head,' but I am still thankful for having come into contact with them.
