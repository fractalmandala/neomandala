It was late at night by the time they reached Prayaga, and audience with the elder paters was possible only the next morning. Ketumana requested his hosts not to awake uparajan Samvarna, tired from the journey himself. The rajanalaya here was constructed to open out to the confluence, its balconies giving a clear view to the merging ahead. Ketumana was tired but not sleepy, watching the waters glisten under the moonlight, when Vitamsi came looking for him.

They stood in silence for a while, sheer company giving comfort to unsaid thoughts. It was Vitamsi who broke the silence- “Tell me more about your parents.”

Weariness from the battle in the forest bore down upon Ketumana, and on a different night he might have evaded the question. But this was Vitamsi, and he felt like sharing. “My father was seventeen years old when he made clear his disinterest for rule. This was the cause of many arguments between him and grandmother Kashi, who tried to impress upon him his responsibility as the eldest of his line. Apparently they reached a compromise- for I am my father’s ticket out of Kashi. He agreed to a rushed marriage and stayed in Kashi long enough to seed me, after which he was gone and would return only intermittently. My mother I never knew- grandmother Kashi adopted me at birth and raised me as her own.” He had never spoken aloud about his parents, feeling considerably lighter having done so. 

“You were born an heir to Kashi,” Vitamsi commented.

“Birthed for one purpose only,” he said, nodding. 

Vitamsi stared into her cousin’s eyes, third cousin to be exact. There was depth in them she’d never seen in an eighteen-year-old before, a depth that Vitamsi feared she’d fallen in love with. Ketumana returned the stare, lost in thoughts of his own. They stared in silence for a long time, not needing words to express themselves to each other. “You must be tired,” Vitamsi said after a while. “Get some rest.”

Convention, tradition and unfamiliarity all worked together to keep Ketumana from speaking his heart. He wanted her to stay. He wanted to sleep in her arms tonight, the mere thought bringing comfort to him. He settled for nodding wordlessly, grateful that she’d come to him in the first place. Unknown to them, one family member had been observing the whole time, coming to a decision of her own.

Mitrasaha found them at the crack of dawn, the messenger relaying his ardent desire to meet with them. Curious, Grtsamada and Aristanemi assented. The Suryavanshi crown prince was a tall, lean man with a meticulously shaven face and a neat combing to his short hair. On entering the room, without preamble, he kneeled to Grtsamada’s feet- who backed away in alarm.

“Please, crown prince, there is no need for this,” Grtsamada said.

Mitrasaha did not rise. “There is every need for it, rshi. Will you not give me your blessings?”

“Rshi? I am no rshi, crown prince.”

Mitrasaha looked up at that. “So I’ve been told, and I find that most strange. You and your brother Dhanvantari are known to us as rshis. Do you not compile the rituals and prayers of Aryavarta in a grand collection?”

“Compile and create, both,” Aristanemi piped, enjoying the scene.

Mitrasaha’s eyes widened. “A rshi par excellence then, and I must have your blessing.” He reached out for Grtsamada’s feet again, who did not back away this time. Still feeling unsure, Grtsamada placed a tentative hand on Mitrasaha’s head. 

The crown prince finally rose, a suitably gratified look in his eyes. “When rshi Dhanvantari visited us six years ago, we did not realise how consummate a traveller he is. I was hoping to meet him too, but I hear he hasn’t been home for two years now?”

“Two, perhaps three,” Grtsamada said. “We’ve stopped keeping track now. Dhanvantari comes and goes as he pleases.”

“And what about him makes him a rshi?” Aristanemi asked, continuing to find amusement in the strange deference Mitrasaha gave to his elder cousins. 

Mitrasaha frowned. “Surely you jest. Rshi Dhanvantari’s knowledge of herbs, potions and healing is unparalleled in Aryavarta. Our own rshi Vasishtha was blessed to have received part of his knowledge. I too goaded some secrets out of him. What he develops in his travels is no less than a knowledge of life itself.”

Dhanvantari’s hobbies were familiar to his cousins, but it was still strange to think that his actions merited the title of a rshi. For the first time, Grtsamada thought of the larger history and tradition of Aryavarta- and how deep the Suryavansha was embedded in it. Working in isolation in Kashi, Grtsamada had never given thought to what he could learn from venturing out of the city. He said as much to Aristanemi when Mitrasaha had taken their leave.

Aristanemi agreed. “Think of their history. Their founder was Ikshvaku, and if I remember correctly he lived some seven hundred years ago. The Suryavansha really is Aryavarta’s oldest tribe.” Aristanemi thought of Grtsamada’s project- “Can you imagine the amount of prayers they’d remember?”

Grtsamada clearly was imagining it- “Dating from the time of the original maharshis- Vasishtha, Kashyapa, Atri. Maharshi Vasishtha was Ikshvaku’s rajpurohit, right? And Maharshi Kashyapa his grandfather?”

“Or great-grandfather,” Aristanemi said, trying to think of the history lessons delivered by Kashi when he was young. “I think you should have a proper sitting with Mitrasaha. There’s much you will learn from him.”

“I could go to Ayodhya myself,” Grtsamada ventured. “Meet with the current rshi Vasishtha. Would you come?”

Aristanemi sighed, thinking it over. “I would, brother, but for the circumstances. With this possible alliance, and with enemies gathering, I wonder if I am needed here.”

Grtsamada had not forgotten Aristanemi’s performance in the battle last night. His brother had discovered something in himself none had known was there. Grtsamada nodded in understanding. They made their way to Prayaga’s council halls, where clan members and advisors gathered for a historic meet, for it was the largest gathering of Bharatas in thirty-two years. The entire lines of Suhotra and Jahnu were present, and only Kashi was absent from the Sunahotra line. Rajan Ajamidha remembered his grandfather, wondering if Bharata had felt similarly proud when he stared at his clan gathered together. There was a decisive air around Ajamidha this time that he hadn’t carried for a long time. “There will be no debates this time,” he declared, “No arguments, no raking of the past to sully the present. In any case, with the esteemed Suryavanshi guest among us, we must present our best behaviour. Crown prince Mitrasaha is the son of high prince Kosala, and grandson of king Ayuddha- a solar line with no simple ancestry. We are fortunate that the Suryavanshi extend the hand of friendship, surrounded as we are by the Pancha Gana. Crown prince Mitrasaha, will you kindly tell this gathering what you know of the Pancha Gana.”

Mitrasaha related the tale he knew well, beginning with a name he assumed the audience would know- “The old Somavanshi king Nahusha Aila had two sons- Yati and Yayati. Yati the elder gave himself to religion, and Yayati the younger became king after his father. King Yayati ruled for many decades before splitting his kingdom among his five sons- Yadu, Anu, Druhyu, Turvasa and Puru. Yadu, the eldest, got Ekachakra as his capital and west Aryavarta to expand into. Anu received Girivraja and east Aryavarta. Druhyu received the far north-west corners of Aryavarta, capitalled at Gandhara. Turvasa went to Sringara, and then north of the Himalaya. And Aryavarta proper, the heart of the empire, ruled with a martial fist from Pratisthana, went to Yayati’s youngest son Puru.”

Mitrasaha paused, allowing his audience to absorb the information and voice query if they had any. “Ekachakra, Girivraja, Gandhara, Sringara,” Ketumana said, repeating the cities Mitrasaha mentioned. “Four capitals you name for us, but none of these now exist, do they? I have never heard their names.”

Mitrasaha nodded. “You are right, young Bharata, but the tribes these sons established still flourish. Yadavas, Anavas, Purus, Druhyus, Turvasas- the Pancha Gana. This is the threat we face.”

“That leaves a lot to be filled in,” Tritsu said, feeling as curious as his cousin from Kashi. “What happened to these cities? And what have the Pancha Gana been up to in the centuries since?”

There was an obvious deference in Mitrasaha’s voice when he spoke to Tritsu, one that came only when he addressed the elder Bharata line directly. “I know only part of the tale,” he acknowledged. “Some two hundred years ago began a series of events that together changed Aryavarta’s landscape- physical and political both. To the west, after decades of disastrous flooding, the Sarasvati river went dry. Ancient cities like Plaksha, Trigarta, Madra, Vinasana, Mohandvara all dying with it. The river was home to my people- the Suryavansha. When it dried, we migrated east. Along the Yamuna we found rivals- Purus and Yadavas alike. So we went even further, to the hidden streams that tribute the Ganga. The chronicle of this migration is recorded well among my people. We remember names like the twin kings Mandhatra and Sravasti, and Mandhatra’s grandson Sindhudvipa. These men and their armies went to war against the Purus and Yadavas, laying to siege their arrogant cities. Ekachakra, Girivraja, Salibhavana- it was necessary to destroy them to ensure our own survival.”

Mitrasaha paused again, this part of the tale always painful to a Suryavanshi- “But we could not achieve complete victory. Sindhudvipa was lost in the failed sack of Pratisthana, and Mandhatra burnt alive by Yadava guerilla parties. We shook the Pancha Gana’s very foundation, but we nearly lost our own in the process. And then the earthquake came.”

The earthquake- an event every inhabitant of Aryavarta still remembered, so deep was it etched in racial memory. The day the earth shook for what survivors perceived to be an eternity- caving buildings into the ground, changing the flow of rivers in minutes, upending the social and political order. Tritsu remembered this part of his history lessons. It was in the power vacuum the earthquake created that grand patriarch Bharata himself had emerged. 

“The earthquake destabilised us,” Mitrasaha continued. “It scattered my tribe, cutting migratory bands off from each other. Aryavarta itself might have fallen to lasting anarchy, if not for the stabilising rise of your great ancestor. King Bharat brought unity to a fragmented Aryavarta, consolidating lands under one banner for the first time since the Purus held sway, decades before him. But that is where my knowledge ends, for in the years since, we Suryavanshi have been too busy building our homes to keep a keen eye on the rest of Aryavarta. We may know a little about Purus and Yadavas, but nothing about the rest. What has happened in the intervening years with the Pancha Gana, who rules them now and how close are they to each other? These are questions only the Janakas can answer.” 

To the majority gathered, that was an unfamiliar name. “There is much we do not know about Aryavarta,” Ajamidha said by way of explanation, making it clear that he’d conversed with Mitrasaha prior to this council. “And there’s much that we’ve forgotten in our insular decades. The history of Aryavarta, littered with kings and founders, now extends its hand to affect our present. There is much we need to know, and we are fortunate that there are tribes who have continued to chronicle the history of Aryavarta. Chief among them are the Janakas, an ancient people with deep ties to the Suryavansha. With uparajan Ketumana of Kashi’s permission, I would like to call an end to our old rivalry. Let past bloodshed remain in the past- now is the time for the Bharata janapada to rally as one. With Ketumana’s consent, the Bharatas will journey to Janaka lands. We will rediscover Aryavarta’s history before we assert our rightful place in it.”

Ajamidha’s declaration was grand and decisive, leaving no room for his brothers or his son to argue. A rift created in blood more than three decades was now to be repaired, and uparajan Ketumana voiced his humble assent- “You are generous to let the past remain where it belongs, rajan Ajamidha. Our janapada was always meant to be one, and I am grateful for the opportunity to rectify the mistake of decades.”

Ajamidha looked pleased at that, but the elder paters stole bitter glances towards Aristanemi, who noticed. Knowing nothing of the respect they commanded in their clan, Aristanemi challenged- “If you two have something to say, why don’t you say it?”

“Watch your tongue!” Brhat barked before anyone could respond. “These are the elder paters you address.”

The tone had no effect on Aristanemi, who looked to Brhat’s agitation with amused eyes. “And you are?” It was rhetorical, for Grtsamada had already whispered introductions to Aristanemi.

“I am Brhat, son of Ajamidha, grandson to Suhotra, and heir to Bharata!” Brhat said, swelling with his claim.

Aristanemi chuckled. “And I am Aristanemi, son of Shala, grandson to Sunahotra. As for heir to Bharata- well, if things were so neatly settled we’d scarcely be sitting opposite each other today, would we?”

“Speak clearly, son of Shala,” said Dvimidha. “Are you contesting Brhat’s claim?”

Seeing the situation get out of hand again, it was Tritsu who intervened- “Enough, fathers, please. Let us not go down this route yet again.” Behind him, Vitamsi stared at her brother in frank admiration- this was the first time Tritsu had spoken up at a council of elders.

Ketumana pressed Tritsu’s attack, placing an arm on his uncle’s shoulder- “Please, uncle Nemi.” Aristanemi understood and nodded, his behaviour not nearly as charged with rage and resentment.

“Mere words and intent will not be enough, it seems,” Riksha said to Ajamidha. “We will have to seal our alliance with something more tangible.”

“If you have a proposal, sister, I am happy to hear it.”

“Marriage- that great builder of alliances. My own mother was wed to a man who might have contested Bharata one day.”

There was silence in the gathering as people tried to guess the marital alliance Riksha proposed. “A fine proposal, sister,” Ajamidha agreed, “But what link do you have in mind?”

Riksha turned her full gaze to Vitamsi, keeping it there as she declared- “There are two houses that need unification today, and in each house is a descendant of the right age. In the line of Suhotra, princess Vitamsi has been of suitable age for a while. And in the line of Sunahotra there is uparajan Ketumana.”

Waves of murmurs, whispers and speculations broke out at that, as each member of the janapada assessed the idea with the people next to them. Caught by surprise, Ketumana and Vitamsi kept their eyes low- not knowing what to say or do. Only Tritsu grinned widely, knowing well the unconfessed love his sister and cousin held for each other. 

Rajan Ajamidha looked unsure for the first time today, his heart taking to Riksha’s idea but mind unknowing of whether Ketumana would accept it. “What does the line of Sunahotra say to this proposal?”

Ketumana spoke up before either of his uncles could respond- “I humbly accept the proposal, rajan. But it is important to know what princess Vitamsi thinks. We cannot do this without her consent.”

That surprised Brhat, who did not expect such a gesture from Ketumana. In any case, brides-to-be were rarely asked for their view on matters of political matrimony. He looked to his daughter, who gazed at the Kashi uparajan with a mix of frank admiration and longing. “I also accept this proposal,” Vitamsi said. 

Rajan Ajamidha thumped his cushion, beaming widely. “That settles it then- the lines of Suhotra and Sunahotra shall be one, sealed by matrimony. When shall we set the date?”

“We must not lose sight of our primary objective,” uparajan Samvarna intervened. “If it is to your consent, rajan, I propose we first meet with the Janakas. Let us know all we need to about our enemies, potential and real both. Then we can prepare for wedding festivities. In any case, we shouldn’t do anything before taking mother Kashi’s consent and blessings.”

“Cousin Samvarna speaks wisely,” Grtsamada agreed, knowing how his mother might feel about Ketumana’s marriage being struck without her presence. 

“I will go to her,” Ketumana said, “And take her blessings. But uparajan Samvarna is right- we must go to the Janakas first.”

“So be it,” Ajamidha declared, making to end the discussion. “Crown prince Mitrasaha will take us to the Janakas. Uparajan Samvarna, you will lead the expedition. Uparajan Ketumana, as a sign of our new alliance, I suggest you join the expedition. Whatever we learn, you learn too.”

“I agree, rajan Ajamidha.”

“I’m going,” said Tritsu, surprised to see neither his father nor grandfather offer resistance.

Vitamsi opened her mouth, but Brhat cut her off and indicated that he would join as well- “Yes, yes, girl. You can come.”

“We’re coming too,” Aristanemi spoke on behalf of himself and Grtsamada, knowing that his cousin wouldn’t let an opportunity to visit the Janakas pass. 

“It’s settled then,” Samvarna said. “We leave in the morning. Crown prince Mitrasaha, how long can we expect the journey to be?”

“The distance might not be far, but we’ll be slowed by the forest and countless streams. I reckon it can take up to a week to reach Mithila- their capital.”

The Yadava veteran was not known to be expressive. “I thought I’d never see you again,” he said impassively, appraising the man in front of him with eyes that hid a mild sense of pride. 

“I didn’t think it would happen either,” Darsana confessed. “When I took your leave ten years ago, I didn’t think I would return.”

“What brings you back then, Darsana Kavya?”

“News of trouble, my rajan. I heard we might be going to war.”

Vrishna Yadava raised his eyebrows. “Did you now? In lands as far as Dasavarsha?”

“No, in Mulyasthana,” Darsana replied, not sharing that he was headed to Haradvara. “Is it true, rajan? Are we headed to war?”

“And if we are?”

“Then I submit myself to your service once again.”

“Why would I need you now, Darsana Kavya. You made it clear that you did not want to serve the tribe any more. You pleaded me to let you go.”

Darsana bowed in acknowledgment. “I know, my lord- and I wouldn’t have left without your consent.”

“I had no place for unwilling soldiers.”

“I we are going to war, I am most willing, rajan.”

Vrishna Yadava chuckled, the mirth not reaching his eyes. “Even now your submission is conditional then, is it? If we are not at war, you will depart my halls once again?”

Darsana sighed, remembering now how rajan Vrishna Yadava had always been difficult to deal with. “Only with your consent, again, my rajan.”

Vrishna Yadava nodded, the hint of a genuine smile now breaking on his face. “Ten years,” he observed. “Do you even remember how to hold an axe anymore?”

“I never forgot.”

Vrishna nodded again, seeming satisfied. “War does brew in Aryavarta,” he confirmed. “But I am not at its head any longer.”

“My lord?”

“Look at me, Darsana. I am seventy-two now. All I ever wanted was to secure peace and stability for my people. And we did secure that, did we not? You would have never departed if our mission was still alive.”

“I am glad you know that, rajan.”

“Wouldn’t have let you leave if I didn’t, Darsana. But you remember my son, don’t you? He’s only a few years older to you, and far more ambitious than the both of us combined.”

Darsana remembered Mathu Yadava well, as also his ambition and inclination for excess. “What has he done now?”

“Poked a sleeping giant, I’m afraid,” Vrishna observed. “He attacked Kampilya- that Bharata outpost we kept an eye on for years.”

“And who attacked Kashi then?”

“I wouldn’t know. As I said- I am no longer at the head of things. My son is rajan now, and if you still wish to aid your tribe in war, it’s him you must submit to.”

Darsana fell silent, reassessing his priorities. Working under Vrishna Yadava was one thing, but Mathu Yadava was built of a different mould. Darsana had never liked the younger Yadava, unable to reconcile his amoral conduct and war mongering. 

“He’s built a new settlement for himself,” Vrishna continued, knowing what Darsana considered in silence. “Calls it Mathura, after himself, of course. You’ll find him there, if you wish to.”

“What would you have me do, my lord?”

“I freed you from my rule a decade ago, Darsana. I’m not tying you back to it now. What you do is your choice. The Bharatas took Kampilya back with swift ferocity, led by that Samvarna- you remember him?”

“I do,” Darsana said. Samvarna was a highly capable general and tactician, a member of the core Bharata clan.

“My son won’t stop with one attack, and the Bharata war machinery does not slow down once it gets going. So war certainly is coming to Aryavarta, my boy. And my son is not alone.”

Dread arose in Darsana. “No,” he said weakly. “Not Mahismata.”

“Yes, him,” Vrishna confirmed. “Mathu has recruited the help of his uncles Mahismata and Vidarbha.”

“Then war is already here,” Darsana commented grimly. 

“My son will need you,” Vrishna confessed. “He will need someone to look out for him.”

Darsana took a deep breath, knowing what he had to do. “I will go to him, my lord,” he said.

Hastina was brought here in a blindfold, only Mantim permitted with him. They were allowed to keep their swords though, and Hastina reasoned it was because two armed men were no danger to a large number any way. The blindfold was removed when they were inside a modest mud hut, and the sound of gushing water nearby told Hastina that they were still near the Yamuna. For decades he had heard their names, coming to him through rumours and whispers of affairs in west Aryavarta. Some stories sang praise of them, others chronicled bold atrocity. Some called them cowherds and pastoralists, others said they were raiders and looters. Hastina had clearly underestimated the reports, thinking of these men as trifle warlords- rabid remnants of a dead tribe. How wrong that was, he now realised. The three Yadavas that sat before him bore formidable demeanours, one look in their eyes telling him that tales of their brutality, aggression and conquering zeal were not exaggerated. These were men of war and blood, testified by a thick scar running across the youngest’s face. A hierarchy was evident among them, and it was Mathu who spoke on their behalf. 

“Kampilya was just the beginning,” Mathu declared confidently after Hastina complimented them for the attack on Kampilya. “A way to test the Bharata resolve. But my target is Prayaga itself- I want the heart of Aryavarta.”

*As do I*, Hastina thought, *and that’s going to be a problem. *Aloud, he said- “Eradicating the Bharatas is my mission as well. But every day we waste gives them time to prepare and get stronger. Already their estranged lines have reunited, and reports tell me they now extend a hand to the Suryavansha.” 

That last name got a reaction to the Yadavas’ faces, as Hastina expected. Tribal rivalries in Aryavarta ran deep, and none perhaps deeper than that between the Yadavas and Suryavanshis.

“Those locusts again,” Mahismata the youngest commented. There was an air to him that Hastina found unsettling, a malevolence he’d not felt in anyone before. 

“What is your proposal then, Hastina Puru?” Mathu asked.

“The alliance between our people is old,” Hastina said. “Natural even, for Yadu and Puru were blood-brothers. We have spent decades gathering our strengths, reorganising our people and bringing order to the tribe. It is time we combine this strength.”

“We are not alone in this natural alliance, are we?” Mahismata asked in a tone that made Hastina wonder how much he knew. “I hear the Anavas make bold moves in the east. Anu was a brother too, was he not?”

“Indeed,” Hastina agreed, “and I have already established contact with them. They are with us in this war.” The lie was necessary, for he wanted to give the Yadavas an impression of leadership and control. When the dust settled, there would be place for only one king of Aryavarta, and when the time was right Hastina would point out, politely at first, that the primary kingdom had gone to Puru- thus Hastina’s by right. 

“We’ve been keeping an eye on Prayaga,” Vidarbha the third Yadava commented. “A travelling party left the city a few nights ago. There was intent in their pace and course.”

Hastina nodded, hearing of the same from his own spies. “It seems they are led by a Suryavanshi prince, headed either to Ayodhya or beyond.”

“So, all important members of their clans will be in the party,” Mahismata observed, gears turning in his head. “We could end this war before it begins. I will go to them myself.”

Hastina did not expect this eagerness. “What do you mean?”

“One successful attack party is all that’s needed to end this,” Mahismata said. “I will find this group of Bharatas and have their heads.”

“We don’t even know where they are headed, and what strength they might muster if needed.”

All three Yadavas chuckled simultaneously, as if Hastina’s comment had triggered a private joke. “It’s not numbers that matter in sudden raids, Hastina Puru,” Mahismata informed him. “Tactics, speed and lethality do. All of which I can *muster* when needed.”

Hastina nodded, not reacting to Mahismata’s obviously mocking tenor. “I wish you well then,” he lied, hoping instead that Mahismata’s overconfidence would remove him from the equation. Mathu and Vidarbha seemed far easier to deal with.

On the third night of their trek, Ketumana finally found the opportunity to converse with Vitamsi alone. “I am glad that you consented to this marriage, princess.”

Vitamsi made a face. “Please don’t call me princess, uparajan. All of you have such active titles- ones that indicate your stature and duty both. What does princess indicate other than something hapless perhaps?”

Ketumana smiled, nodding. “I didn’t think you’d like that title.”

“Oh really? And how did you figure that, heir of Kashi?”

“It’s just as you said. I didn’t think a woman who likes the sword would like, as you implied, a passive title.”

“And you’re okay with me liking the sword?”

Ketumana smiled again. “I am both proud and honoured to fight alongside my wife. Not too many men can say that.”

Vitamsi raised an eyebrow, teasing- “Wife? I’m not your wife yet, uparajan.”

“I think I am allowed to presume, given the circumstances.”

Vitamsi continued to tease. “Are you now? It’s quite convenient for grandmother Riksha to have arranged things for you, *husband*. But when this expedition is done, I will have you submit a formal proposal to me- directly.”

Ketumana bowed. “A most fair command, *princess*.”

“You two are quite a sight, you know that.” Tritsu’s grin was from ear to ear as he walked up. 

Vitamsi sighed with exaggeration. “Ah, hello, brother. I was just thinking that it’s about time for you to interrupt again.”

“C’mon now,” Tritsu feigned hurt. “You’ll have your time together later, but I need company too. Uparajan Samvarna and father converse in whispers. And Ketumana, your uncles are inscrutable. I don’t know what I’d even say to them. As for this crown prince, what do you two make of him?”

“I’m not sure,” Ketumana confessed. “I keep thinking there’s things he knows but does not share.”

“Like maybe he’s leading us to a trap?” Tritsu speculated.

“That’s quite an elaborate trap,” Vitamsi said. “Why take us all the way to Mithila when he could kill us here in the forest?”

“I know, I know. I’m just thinking aloud. So many tribes, so many battles, so much history. There’s a lot about Aryavarta’s past we don’t know- but everything that’s happening now emerges from that, right? These Suryavanshis could be pulling strings we don’t even know exist.”

“There’s some venturing in the dark we’ll have to do before the eyes adjust,” Ketumana said thoughtfully.

Tritsu and Vitamsi stared, the former commenting- “There’s a philosopher in you, cousin Ketumana! Or should I call you brother-in-law now?”

Ketumana flashed a smile, the one that Vitamsi had grown fond of. “We are brothers in blood, cousin Tritsu. No law is needed for that.”

On the fifth morning, as the sun’s rays cleared through the clouds, the grand Himalayan mountains finally came into view. Even at this distance their snow-clad peaks rose proudly into the sky, indicating how high they really reached. The dense, nearly suffocating fig forests of the Gangetic plain now gave way to tall, less dense sal trees. Mitrasaha was a keen guide, pointing out different species of trees and reverentially naming the streams they crossed. This was home to his people, these streams where were they rallied and settled their towns after their migration. Gomati, Sarayu, Jahnavi- tributaries to the Ganga further downstream. The Jahnavi was the last one they crossed, on the sixth day, after which there was a fair bit of hiking as the ground gradually rose into rugged foothills and ravines. The Himalayan mountains were formidably close now, their snow shining bright white under the sun’s rays. Mitrasaha took to naming the discernible peaks, confessing that their names came from trans-Himalayan people. The highest one was called Jomo Lungma, though his own people had come to call it Sagarmatha. He set a hard pace through this terrain, bringing them to the town of Mithila by the evening. 

Half the town was carved into the rocky mountainside, its hutments looking more like sculpted caves than the traditional brick shapes found in river-cities. Fierce rivers gushed in enormous waterfalls on either side, and entry to the town was made by crossing an ancient-looking, near dilapidated bridge. Tritsu reasoned that this could not be the only access to Mithila- but it was the only one being shown to them. Grim, fair-skinned people welcomed them, receiving Mitrasaha with bear hugs and affection but approaching the rest with respectful formality. The Janaka rajan was eager to meet them, they were told, before being offered refreshments and a place to rest. Samvarna suggested they meet the rajan and thank his hospitality first. They received curious glances at that, and even Mitrasaha’s impassive look slipped for a moment. 

Mithila’s royal halls were carved completely inside the hill-rock, tall pillars of granite rising to an elaborately carved ceiling far above their heads. Lamps hung from these pillars, their flames dancing with shadows to create a skittish, unsettling air. A darkish tunnel opened into another massive hall, at the end of which a slender, aged but graceful woman sat upon a throne of rock. The Bharatas exchanged uncertain looks, and Mitrasaha whispered- “Forgive me, for I should have realised earlier. Among our people the titles of rajan and king are gender-agnostic.”

This was rajan Maini Janaka then, ruler of the Janaka tribe. She reminded Ketumana of his grandmother, bearing her white and grey hair in a similarly tight bun. But the similarity disappeared when she smiled, for it genuinely reached her eyes and made them twinkle in a way Ketumana could not remember Kashi’s eyes ever doing. “Welcome, dear Bharatas,” she said as they approached, getting up and giving them a small bow. “And you, Mitra! I’ll deal with you later! How long has it been since you visited us?”

Mitrasaha returned Maini’s genial smile. “Too long, rajan mother.”

Sweetened, red-coloured drinks were placed in front of them by attendants, followed by dried, whole milk laddoos. Uparajan Samvarna spoke for the Bharatas- “We thank you for welcoming us, rajan Maini. There is much we have to learn from you.”

Maini nodded. “I surmised as much. And how may I address you, dear Bharata?”

“I am uparajan Samvarna, son to Riksha and born in the line of Jahnu- Bharata’s daughter.”

Maini smiled wisely. “And his sons were Suhotra and Sunahotra,” she added. “Suhotra in turn was father to three sons, the eldest of which is Ajamidha. His son- Brhat, and his grandson- Tritsu. I am familiar with the Bharata family tree, uparajan. Just as I am familiar with the family trees of all prominent Aryavarta tribes. Our scribes here in Mithila have been assiduously recording them for centuries.”

“A most noble and generous task, rajan Maini. And that’s what brings us to you today. Prominent tribes now resurge along the Ganga and Yamuna, but we know next to nothing about their lineages. We were hoping you could educate us.”

A silent look was exchanged between Maini and Mitrasaha- one that Samvarna spotted. “You could begin with the relation between Suryavansha and Janakas,” he said. “We know you are related, but not exactly how.”

There was an amiable air about Maini, the grace in her demeanour hinting to the Bharatas what true royalty looked like. “The oldest story of them all is not even the story to begin with,” she said. “We are related yes, but in reality not quite. The Janakas originate from king Nimi, who was Ikshvaku’s second son. But Nimi was adopted- not related to him by blood.”

“I thought that was just a rumour,” Samvarna commented.

Maini narrowed her eyes at the uparajan. “You do know some things then,” she said. “But it’s no rumour. Nimi was in fact the son of a rakshasa, adopted by Ikshvaku in hopes of creating a lasting ceasefire with them. But our link to the Suryavansha is more tenuous than that. You see, king Nimi Janaka did not bear progeny. His successor, king Sapya Janaka, was adopted as well. Nimi found the infant Sapya abandoned in a field and brought him up as his own. Since then, Janaka rajans have maintained the tradition of passing on their reign to adopted children. I was adopted by my predecessor, and I have already adopted my successor. Unlike the other tribes of Aryavarta, Janakas are not a blood-clan.”

To the Bharatas that was a most strange arrangement, their very foundation being blood ties. Many questions rummaged in Tritsu’s head. “Nimi and Sapya were kings,” he observed. “But you bear the title of rajan. How did this come about?”

“A fine question, young man. You must be Tritsu, or is it Ketumana?”

“I am Tritsu, rajan Maini. Son of Brhat-”

“Grandson of Ajamidha, Sauhotri,” Maini completed, smiling widely. “Your name must be short for Tritsuya, is it not?”

“Yes, rajan.”

“A triple sacrifice,” she said, parsing out the meaning of his name.

“Tritsu was born to us after three offerings to the devas,” Brhat explained.

Maini nodded, eyebrows curving in comprehension. “And this must be Vitamsi then,” she said, turning to her. “How beautiful you are, no wonder your birth made your parents feel *free from darkness*.” Vitamsi bowed unsurely, never having given much thought to the meaning of her name.

“To answer your question then, Tritsuya,” Maini continued. “Nimi and Sapya were called kings because that title was in vogue in their time. Desirous of creating something larger than a janapada, Ikshvaku was the first to claim that title in Aryavarta- he shed the title of rajan and called himself a king. His descendants followed his lead. But that was centuries ago, and much has changed in Aryavarta since then. No rajan today commands a territory as large as Ikshvaku or Nahusha did in their prime. There are no empires, only janapadas- many of which occupy no more than a city or two. I think it would be quite pompous to call myself a king then, would it not? A simple rajan will suffice.”

 Once again Tritsu wondered to the vast history of Aryavarta that he was not aware of- and how everything in the present was linked to it, various threads that now converged to create modern Aryavarta’s conflicted political situation. A situation that both the Suryavanshi and the Janakas seemed to have a better reading of. The implication of Maini’s narration was not lost on Tritsu- these tribes claimed their descent from kings. And Mitrasaha did speak of his own grandfather Ayuddha as a king, not a rajan. But what of Bharata then?

“We think of our grand patriarch as a rajan,” Tritsu said. “Yet crown prince Mitrasaha called him a king. How is that?”

Rajan Maini chuckled, clearly enjoying the exchange. “I’ll let Mitra explain that one.”

“I wanted to bring this up myself,” Mitrasaha acknowledged. “When I first visited Prayaga, I was surprised to hear you speak of him as rajan. Bharata was no mere rajan- he created a vast empire that stretched all the way to Gandhara in the far north-west. He was a king.”

The Bharatas gathered exchanged frowns among themselves, surprised to hear this of their own ancestor. Rajan Maini observed with sharp eyes, finally addressing Samvarna- “Jahnavi, surely you know of this?”

All eyes turned to the uparajan, who calmly returned Maini’s gaze- equally sharp and scrutinising. “I salute your knowledge, rajan. It takes an unbroken line of assiduous record-collection to be aware of such things.” They stared at each other for a long while, a silent communication passing between them. When they broke off, it was as if they’d come to an agreement. “Rajan Maini called me a Jahnavi, which in this case was a deliberate reference,” Samvarna said to his family. “My grandmother Jahnu was born to the grand patriarch when he was only sixteen. Long before he became king, and long before his sons were born. The life of Bharata that we remember is the life he led after the sons were born, when his attention turned to the Gangetic plains in earnest. But years before that he was campaigning in lands far and remote.” Samvarna looked at Tritsu directly- “To understand the difference between Bharata the king and Bharata the rajan, you need to understand Bharata’s entire life. I will narrate it to you one day, Tritsu.”

Samvarna was grim when he said that, but the mirth had returned to Maini. “Come now, uparajan. What better moment than now? We are all here, and surely there’s nothing you need fear revealing to me. Let us hear the story of Bharata as it is known to his firstborn’s line.”



**22**

“Parts of the tale you might know, other parts not. The story was told to me by my grandmother when I was a child. What you must remember is that she was born to Bharata when he was sixteen- fourteen years before Suhotra was born. She was with Bharata through it all, and on the day he died he even acknowledged it- I was there.”

Samvarna paused, glancing at Maini for her reaction. The Janaka rajan in turn only looked curiously at the Bharatas- knowing the tale well herself. Samvarna continued- “Bharata was born in a city far west of Aryavarta called Gandhara. His mother named him Sarvadamana, and for many years he grew up without knowing his father. When he was twelve, there was a devastating attack on Gandhara by the army of a king in Aryavarta. That’s when Sarvadamana’s mother Shakuntala told him the truth- they were of Aryavarta too. Sarvadamana’s father was a man in Aryavarta of royal descent, and he’d promised her that one day he would send for them.”

That was the story of Dushyanta and Shakuntala, narrated in romantic terms by the grand patriarch himself to the likes of Samvarna, Brhat and Grtsamada when they were but children. Samvarna tried not to digress- “Sarvadamana waited three years after that, but then he could stop himself no more. At the age of fifteen he set out for Aryavarta, determined to find his father. And from Shakuntala he received a ring, one that Dushyanta had given to her long ago. That ring was to be Sarvadamana’s way of identifying himself to his father- who he finally met two years after he left Gandhara. During this time he’d fallen in love, married his first wife, and fathered a daughter- Jahnu.”

“With the ring in his hand, Sarvadamana was accepted with elation by Dushyanta, but his clan members were not so convinced. They never quite accepted Sarvadamana’s claim to Dushyanta’s growing empire. Dushyanta wanted to be a king, and for the next five years Sarvadamana campaigned with his father- eventually bringing even Gandhara under the sway of Dushyanta’s banner.” Absorbed in his narration, eager to tell the tale as he knew it, Samvarna did not notice the strange glances Mitrasaha and Maini exchanged when he talked of Dushyanta. Tritsu did, making a mental note to share this with the uparajan later. 

“Some time during this period, joyed by the victories his son had brought to him, Dushyanta gave him a name- Bharata, the auspicious one. When Bharata was twenty-four, his father made him king, and Bharata inherited an empire that extended from Gandhara in the west to Plaksha in the east. An empire he had helped build. That was the man my grandmother knew, and I believe that’s the man the Suryavanshis and Janakas remember.”

“Indeed,” Maini agreed. “But not the man your clan elected to remember. Why is that, uparajan?”

“The trouble started after Dushyanta’s death, when his clan members united in open rebellion against Bharata- rejecting his kingship. The empire broke apart in the wake of this rebellion, and Bharata had to flee with his family and few aides. For more than a decade they were on the run, and in this time Suhotra and Sunahotra were born. They were born to a different man- this was not the ambitious, all-conquering Bharata that Jahnu knew. This was a jaded, defeated and near alone Bharata. The king was dead, only the rajan of a very small tribe remained.”

“The remainder of this tale you know well, for in the years after that as his sons grew older, Bharata regained some of that old ambition. With his sons at the head of a new, conquering army, he established his janapada at Prayaga, opposite the defeated ruins of Pratisthana- the sign of a new Aryavarta. In this new Aryavarta, rajan Bharata wanted to forget his past. He wanted no link to the clan that scorned him, and none with the far away cities he once conquered. He told little of this past to his sons, but the daughter knew. And he swore her to secrecy- to never bring up the man she had known as her father. A final way for him to forget his early life and start the janapada anew. This is why we remember him as rajan, but others as far away as Gandhara still remember the king.”

“But the daughter broke the oath, clearly,” Maini prompted.

“Yes,” Samvarna acknowledged. “She told my mother and me the tale, in turn swearing us to secrecy. But Bharata the rajan was not a seer, he had no idea what would happen in the decades after his death, or that his descendants might need to know the whole truth.”

“No justification needed, uparajan,” Maini said. “It is good for the Bharatas to know their true origins, and perhaps their claim to Aryavarta itself.”

“And yet this is only part of the tale,” Samvarna said. “For we are not the only one with a potential claim to Aryavarta. And while I may know the story of Bharata, I know little of the Pancha Gana- or even of the Suryavansha. That’s what brings us to you, rajan Janaka. There is a complete tale of Aryavarta that we need to know, one that only you can tell us.”

“The complete tale of Aryavarta,” Maini Janaka repeated with raised eyebrows. “Now there’s an ambitious and formidable task! Aryavarta is old, dear Bharatas, older than we can even remember. It has gone through many cycles, many civilisations, many empires. Once, millennia ago, it was only one part of a larger realm- Varaha Prithviya. This was the age of devas and asuras, when Indras and Vritras waged countless wars. But the Aryavarta that we know began in earnest some eight hundred years ago- when a rajan by the name of Marici led his people back to their homeland.”

“Marici, the father of maharshi Kashyapa!” Grtsamada said, not expecting the history of Aryavarta to begin with this ancient lineage.

“Indeed, and you must be rshi Grtsamada of Kashi?”

“Yes, rajan Maini,” Grtsamada responded, knowing that Maini did not need telling that he did not claim this title himself, or that he was not called so in Kashi.

“Marici was a solar descending from the line of Aurvan Surya, the last Surya deva,” Maini continued. “He reunited his tribe’s fragmented bands and brought them back to Aryavarta. His descendants began the story of our land, creating the modern Aryavarta. Marici’s son you just heard of- maharshi Kashyapa. Dozens of prayers he composed survive to us in exact form even today, their depth and relevance justifying his elevation to a maharshi. Kashyapa’s grandson was Vaivasvat- who founded the tradition of record-keeping that we maintain to this day. And Vaivasvat’s son, the Adiraja- Ikshvaku himself. These were Aryavarta’s founding fathers. The Suryavansha traces its descent from them, and by extension- from the Surya devas of a forgotten past.”

The Bharatas looked to Mitrasaha anew, understanding now the royal and proud air he carried. Tritsu wondered if he was alone in feeling concern. The Suryavansha had extended a hand of friendship to the Bharatas, but what hierarchy did they envision in the future? On one hand, they referred to Bharata’s status as a king of Aryavarta. On the other hand, they descended from the first king himself. Tritsu wondered how there could ever be peace in a world rife with conflicting claims and ambitions. 

Maini continued. “Ikshvaku’s father Manu’s legacy does not end with the tradition of record keeping. Manu fathered a daughter, Ila, who was wed to man called Budha.” Maini turned to Grtsamada now- “I’m sure you’re familiar with the name of maharshi Atri?”

“I am, rajan Maini. Another of Aryavarta’s first maharshis, along with Kashyapa and Vasishtha.”

“And do you know of Atri’s own lineage? Like Marici’s people traced their descent from a Surya, Atri’s traced theirs from a Soma. And the Budha that Manu wed his daughter to was Atri’s son. In this way the Suryavansha and Somavansha were tied by marriage early in Aryavarta’s history. This is why most people of Aryavarta call themselves manava- children of Manu. Whether you’re born solar or lunar, you are born to descendants of Manu.”

“Not us,” Samvarna commented.

“Go far back enough, and I’m sure you will find links, dear uparajan,” Maini said cryptically, continuing before Samvarna could respond. “To Ila and Budha was born Pururava- founder of the Somavansha dynasty of kings. As nephew of Ikshvaku, he received special training from the Adiraja, and for a few generations after them their empires expanded under competent sons and grandsons. Pururava’s grandson was Nahusha Aila, arguably Aryavarta’s greatest king ever. The empire he wielded is said to be nearly double the size that Ikshvaku once did, reaching deep into south Aryavarta even. Nahusha’s elder son abdicated the throne, dedicating his life to prayer and ritual instead. Rshi Yati made great contributions to the sacred scriptures, but he never claimed the title of maharshi himself. His younger brother, Yayati, became king after Nahusha, and in a way this Yayati seeded the troubles that now face you.”

“He was father to the Pancha Gana founders,” Samvarna completed.

“Yes. Yayati had five sons- Yadu, Anu, Druhyu, Turvasa and Puru. The story of how Yayati split his empire must be known to you by now, so I will tell you what happened after the split. But this is what you need to know about the sons of Yayati- each was a capable ruler and strategic conqueror. And Yayati’s splitting of his empire was not done arbitrarily. He gave the heart of it to Puru- the youngest and most inexperienced. But he sought to protect that heart by sending the older sons to each corner- making sure that Aryavarta’s borders were protected by strong hands. If not for these elder sons and their descendants, we might have been overridden by foreign tribes long ago. So, I will tell you of Puru last. First, let me tell you of the elder sons.”

“As eldest among them, Yadu is remembered better than the rest. We even have descriptions of his physical appearance- built like a bull. One folktale sings that his lower half was bigger than his upper, his thighs and calves bulging like those of the bulls he liked to shepherd. From his actions, Yadu appears to be a ruthless military general- a capacity that his line retains even today. Yadu’s capital was the city Ekachakra, settled at the confluence of the Yamuna and Charmanvati rivers. This confluence was as sacred to them as Prayaga is to you now, and for six generations they thrived and spread out from here. Some of the later rajans in this line tried to colonise the Sarasvati, where they encountered Mitrasaha’s ancestors- the Suryavanshis that patrolled from cities like Vinasana and Sivobheda. This seeded a rivalry that lasts to this day, deep and visceral.”

“The Sarasvati was drying up by then,” Mitrasaha added. “Our cities were being abandoned, and our great migration east had commenced.”

“Things came to a head in the time of the twin Suryavanshi kings Mandhatra and Sravasta,” Maini said. “But before that, let us cover the Pancha Gana. Of the Yadavas I have told you. Now hear of the Anavas, the descendants of Anu- the ones that attacked Kashi.”

“History remembers Anu as relatively unambitious. For years he’d held his father’s eastern outpost of Girivraja, preventing foreign tribes from the east from spreading into Aryavarta proper. In Yayati’s split he inherited Girivraja, and the Anavas removed themselves from Aryavarta’s affairs from then on. Anu’s descendants migrated further east, where they established a new capital at Tamralipti- nestled in the dense mangroves that line where Ganga meets the ocean. They were absent when the Suryavanshi migration happened, and they were absent when the Suryavanshi-Yadava wars commenced. They resurfaced a few years ago, when we began hearing names of rajan Bali.”

“A man I’ve met,” Samvarna offered. “And two of his sons- Anga and Vanga.”

Maini raised an eyebrow, looking surprised. “This I did not know. When was this, uparajan?”

“Some twelve years ago. I was leading a scouting mission south-east of Kashi when we bumped into Bali and his small fighting force. The battle was overwhelmingly in our favour, but it was fierce. We captured a few of the men but Bali and his sons escaped. From the captives we learnt of them and their names.”

“Then they’ve been keeping an eye on us for longer than we suspected,” Maini said. “Which is interesting. Unlike his forefathers, Bali places great importance on his ancient lineage. He’s said to have instructed each of his six sons to be colonisers like the great kings and rajans of old. The Anavas are unpredictable, but they could be dangerous. We do not know what their true intent is, and whether Bali’s inclination for the past includes a desire for Aryavarta proper.”

“And what of the Druhyus and Turvasas?”

“The Turvasas are of no concern, I am sure,” Maini said confidently. “Yayati sent Turvasa south, beyond the Dandakvana. There he established a realm called Asmaka, and his descendants went further south still. They haven’t been heard of back north since then, though we do have reports that they’ve become a naval people- faring the great oceans that lie on either side of Dravidadesa. But the Druhyus are important. Since the time of Yadu and Druhyu, and for many generations after, their two tribes maintained close relations. They often married into each other’s clans, to the extent that in many places along the Sindhu and the Sarasvati the names Yadava and Druhyu were used interchangeably. A century before the Suryavanshi migration, a great Druhyu warlord established a city in his name- Gandhara, the birthplace of your founder.”

Maini paused to relish the looks of awe on her audience’s faces before continuing. “When the Suryavanshi and Yadavas came into conflict, Gandhara sent his grandsons to the latter’s aid. We can be sure they still retain those old ties, and any conflict with the Yadavas today should expect the addition of unknown Druhyu factors. All these tales come together at the Suryavanshi migration and its aftermath, but the final thread is the most important- Puru. Yayati’s youngest son, who received the heart of his empire. It stretched from Plaksha in the north, at the Himalayan foothills, the only city along the Sarasvati that survives to this day, to Pratisthana- jewel of Aryavarta. Of this great city I need not tell you much- your grand patriarch destroyed it and founded his capital opposite the confluence. From Plaksha to Pratisthana, many Puru towns flourished along and around the Ganga.” Maini turned to Grtsamada again- “There were great rshis in this tribe. Names like Kanva and Medhatithi.”

“Supreme composers of prayers, deserving of the title of maharshis,” Grtsamada said, continuing to marvel at how much his Janaka host knew, and he didn’t.

“Indeed,” Maini agreed. “But their elder pater Yati had set the tradition- these humble rshis would not seek the same stature as those of old- Kashyapa, Atri and Vasishtha. There are fourteen critical prayers attributed to rshis Kanva and Medhatithi together, do you know of them, Grtsamada?”

“I do, rajan. I committed them to memory through sheer rote when I was a boy.”

Maini nodded. “We won’t bore the others with intricacies, Grtsamada, but later I will tell you of better ways to commit the prayers to memory.”

Grtsamada nodded, looking eager. Maini continued- “History remembers Puru to be a prolific father, and we have conflicting records of six, seven and even nine sons. For a while they retained the title of Somavanshis, but soon there were multiple lines calling themselves only Purus. There was some sort of internal hierarchy, with the Pratisthana line gaining royal and martial precedence while the Plaksha line acquired ritual leadership. Thus developed the Purus, under kings like Tamsu and Ahimyati, when they too came into conflict with the Suryavansha. This then was Aryavarta’s first era- from the time of Ikshvaku to the time his descendants migrated east and set everything else into disarray. I will tell you their story now.”

“The story of Aryavarta, like the story of the Suryavansha, started along the Sindhu, Sarasvati and their tributaries. From their Himalayan origins to the point where they met the ocean, these rivers were home to grand cities like Avisari, Sringara, Harayupa, Mulyasthana, Vitabhya and Vinasana. Along the Sindhu, from the west, the Suryavansha faced one eternal problem- Dasas. That foreign tribe and the Suryavanshi were locked in conflict from Ikshvaku’s time, and it wavered and subsided in phases in the generations since. The Suryavanshi never found a final solution, and when the Sarasvati began drying they realised that they might have to leave their ancestral homeland. The decision was made by twin kings Mandhatra and Sravasta, who along with Mandhatra’s son and grandson led various Suryavanshi bands east. No soon did they approach the Yamuna that conflicts with Yadavas began, soon spreading to the Purus as well. Mandhatra and Sravasta spent decades defending their people from Yadava raiders and Puru armies, soon finding that both Yamuna and Ganga were heavily colonised- leaving no space for them. A final decision was made- they had to destroy the Yadava and Puru capitals. The attack on Ekachakra was successful and the Yadava capital destroyed. The attack on Plaksha was only half successful, for while the Puru line that survived there was destroyed, an infant grandson was smuggled to safety. The attack on Pratisthana failed, and with it failed most of the Suryavanshi resolve. We remember Mandhatra’s last gambit. He instructed his brother to take the survivors to safety, beyond the Ganga and deeper into the forest. Mandhatra made his own final stand at an unknown location along the Yamuna, where we know through Yadava boasts that he was burnt alive. Sravasta did as his twin instructed, eventually settling the town of Sravasti at the mouth of the Sarayu. To make the Suryavanshi part of this tale short, suffice to say that Sravasta’s line now survives as the Suryavanshi king Ayuddha, his son Kosala, and grandson Mitrasaha.”

“The Suryavansha migration utterly destroyed the Purus- who bore the worst brunt. Their royal Puru lines were killed, and it was many years before the smuggled infant made himself known. By the time he did, there were other contenders as well. The Purus have been a fragmented, confused tribe since then, but a claimant has finally risen. Hastina Puru claims direct descent from Puru and has amassed quite an army to support his claim. He has made no moves against you yet, but of all the Pancha Gana tribes he has the largest grudge against you.”

“Why is that, rajan?” Samvarna asked.

“Remember that the Suryavanshi attack on Pratisthana was a failure. The royal line was lost but the not the city. Pratisthana survived as a Puru city for a few more generations, when a revived conqueror and his two sons set their sights on it.”

The implication was clear, Maini now talked of Bharata, whose sack of Pratisthana was remembered religiously among his descendants. “Bharata’s campaigns brought him into conflicts with Yadavas as well, who too were yet to recover from their conflicts with the Suryavanshi. Add to it the great earthquake, which I’m sure is as well known among your people as it is among mine. The earthquake was the final salvo against a broken, chaotic Aryavarta, and only the Bharatas emerged as a powerful janapada in its aftermath. Untethered to a geographical or political center, the Yadavas fragmented into various sub-clans, each of which has pursued its own destiny since then. But their old alliance is very alive, and one Yadava is a natural friend to another even if they are from stranger sub-clans. Some clans are cowherds, some farmers, some warriors and some nomadic raiders. Of the ones alive today, there are two you must note. The first is Mathu, a powerful Yadava chieftain who has slowly colonised the Yamuna from Khandakvana to what was once Ekachakra. Mathu has a formidable lineage. He is of a sub-clan of Yadavas called the Vrishnis, a name that comes from his father Vrishna Yadava. The Vrishnis are traditionally cowherds, and most of them still retain this vocation. But since the time of Vrishna they have evolved into clan of martial cowherds. They are most likely related to the Yadavas that once ruled Ekachakra, and this heritage gives Mathu much popularity among Yadavas- all looking admiringly to the Vrishni who has conquered the Yamuna. The attack you faced on Kampilya was no doubt at his command. Done with the Yamuna, he will now turn to the Ganga.”

“The other Yadava of concern is Mahismata. We’ve received countless reports of his brutality, his raids sparing not even women and children. His sub-clan is semi-nomadic. They spend three to four months raiding vulnerable towns and villages, and then settle for a couple of months in a city called Ujjayani. We think this city is somewhere in the Vindhyachala, maybe where the Charmanvati river originates. Mahismata would no doubt be aware of Prayaga and Kashi’s prosperity, and you can be sure his scouts have kept an eye on you. Mahismata’s sway among Yadava clans is second only to that of Mathu. While the Vrishnis claim descent from Yadu’s first son, Mahismata’s line descends from his second- Haihaya. Together, these two can bring together the entire Yadava strength. There is a third Yadava called Vidarbha, but whatever lineage he carries is clearly subservient to Mathu and Mahismata’s. This is the account of our enemies, dear Bharatas. And make no mistake, they are *our *enemies. Yadavas and Purus have an equal, if not greater reason to hate the Suryavansha and by extension- the Janakas.” 

“This makes us natural allies,” Mitrasaha added. “And only together can we contend with whatever form the Pancha Gana now takes.”

Samvarna looked genuinely thankful when he bowed to Maini. “We are blessed to have received this narration from you, Janaka rajan. As the story of our own homeland, the history of Aryavarta is sacred history, and it is our privilege that you share it. But one part seems conspicuous by absence- the history of Janakas. We know now of how the rule is passed among your people, but nothing else. When the Sarasvati dried up, when the Suryavanshi migrated, when the Purus flourished and when the Bharatas arose- where were the Janakas?”

“That is a most astute question, uparajan, and I am grateful you ask it. Our involvement in Aryavarta’s political affairs follows the legacy set by our founder. As Ikshvaku’s younger and adopted son, Nimi established a kingdom very late in his life. He chose for his capital a town deep in the Himalaya, many days climb even from here. Having seen enough war under his father, Nimi desired not an empire but a place to call his own. The Janaka kings and rajans after him followed his lead. From our mountain homes we have observed and chronicled it all, but we have never actively participated in it. But in the mountains we grew, soon founding a larger town called Videha- which I invite all of you to visit one day. In all the history I have told to you, the closest we participated was when we gave temporary shelter to Sravasta and his band of Suryavanshi survivors. And since their settlement at Sravasti and other towns, our old ties have been renewed.”

“Hastina Puru, Bali and his sons, Mathu and Mahismata,” Mitrasaha recapitulated. “These are the Pancha Gana leaders we face today. They have already fired the first salvos- Kashi and Kampilya bear evidence of this. Their possible alliance should be a cause of concern for us.”

“It is,” Samvarna agreed. “I must report this to rajan Ajamidha before we make our next move, but it is clear that war brews afresh in Aryavarta.”

There were none in the gathering who disagreed. The guests retired for the night, but Mitrasaha stayed back to ask Maini the question that bothered him. “You did not tell them everything, rajan,” he stated, trying to keep accusation out of his tone. “Why is that?”

Maini did not look happy. “You will have to ask your grandfather that, Mitra. I received instruction from him to leave specific parts out.”



**23**

No one could sleep that night, each processing the vast information they’d received in different ways. Grtsamada and Aristanemi were absent, accepting rajan Maini’s invitation to discuss prayer memorisation and collection in deeper detail. Ketumana and Vitamsi found Tritsu sitting alone, deep in thought. For a while they sat in silence, each lost in sombre recollection. In the distance, moonlight reflected in deep blue hues off the Himalayan peaks.

“One day I want to go there,” Ketumana said.

“Where?” Vitamsi asked.

“To the mountains. To Videha and beyond. They say somewhere in the Himalaya are great glacial lakes, sources of Aryavarta’s rivers. One day I want to see them. But that day is not going to come for a while, is it?”

He asked that to no one in particular, and none responded. War was coming- whether tomorrow, a week, a month or a year from now. And life was going to be nothing but war till it was over. But when would that be? And more importantly to Tritsu, how would that be?

“Think of the best scenario,” he said. “Imagine that we win. Hastina Puru, Bali, the Yadavas- all are wiped out. What do you think happens then? Lasting, eternal peace?”

Ketumana thought he followed his cousin’s reasoning. “We will have to deal with the Suryavansha then,” he said.

Tritsu shook his head. “That’s not my point. Imagine we exist peacefully alongside them, and Mitrasaha is a Bharata ally even when he becomes king. Will there be eternal peace then?”

“What are you getting at, brother?” Vitamsi asked.

“All the stories we heard today- in every war that people fought, they thought theirs was the final war. It’s what Ikshvaku must have thought, or Nahusha, or Mandhatra and Bharata. Something is fundamentally wrong in the way we’re looking at the world, and until we fix that there will be no peace.”

Ketumana ventured another guess- “Each ambitioned to be a king, is that it?”

“Yes, maybe,” Tritsu said, trying to frame his thoughts. “But not that exactly. These things are so tribal, everything revolving around specific clans, their lineages and conflicting claims. Think about it- who is the deserving ruler of Aryavarta? Suryavanshis? Purus? Us? Someone else?”

“We are,” Ketumana said without hesitation. “Bharata was Aryavarta’s last king, and we are his descendants.”

“Ikshvaku was Aryavarta’s first, and Mitrasaha is his descendant,” Tritsu said as a counterpoint. “But you miss my point, Ketumana. I think the entire question is wrong. There is no *deserving* ruler of Aryavarta. This land is home to several tribes, its our common inheritance. As long as we continue to miss this point, we will be at war.”

That was the first time Tritsu had articulated it this way, even to himself. But it was the only explanation that made sense to him. How was one to compare Ikshvaku to Nahusha, or Puru to Bharata? Did each not merit their place in history, and thus did their descendants?

“I understand what you’re saying, brother,” Vitamsi said. “But what is the solution then? We were happy in our existence till we were attacked. We are not the ones to have raked old wars anew.”

Tritsu nodded. “I know. But that’s why I said let us imagine the best scenario. Even if we win now, what is to stop some Yadavas and Purus from rising again a century from now? Even if Mitrasaha as king is our ally, what assurance can we have that his son or grandson will not have grander ambitions? This cycle of each janapada trying to claim all of Aryavarta is what we need to break. But I’m not even sure how.”

“A country of janapadas,” Ketumana said, finally understanding Tritsu’s vision. “Each an inheritor of Aryavarta.”

“A naïve vision,” Vitamsi scoffed. “Especially when surrounded by enemies.”

“Maybe,” Tritsu acknowledged. “But I think of what the grand patriarch did- hiding his more glorious past from his own descendants. He didn’t want us to think of empires, of faraway cities like Gandhara. He wanted us to find a way to exist in peace.”

“Look where that got us,” Vitamsi countered. “We’re perhaps the most ignorant, unprepared janapada in Aryavarta right now. The grand patriarch was no god, Tritsu.”

Tritsu sighed, looking frustrated. “Vitamsi, I don’t disagree with anything you say. Yes, we are surrounded by enemies. Yes, we must gather our strength and defend ourselves. But one day we will have to ask ourselves- what now? I just hope we will not have to wonder- will our descendants have to go to war again?” 



**24**

Rajan Maini was there to personally see the visitors off in the morning, addressing each individually and approaching Samvarna last. “And you, Jahnavi,” she said to him with a characteristic twinkle in her eyes. “It has been my great honour to meet you. When you meet your mother, tell her that the little girl from the market sends her regards. She will know what that means.”

The curious look that came upon Samvarna did not suit his usually impassive demeanour. He bowed and touched Maini’s feet, reiterating his words from the night before. “The honour is ours, rajan. On behalf of the Bharata janapada, I thank you for hosting us in your city. And I hope to visit Videha with you one day.”

Crown Prince Mitrasaha volunteered to return with them till the Gomati river, where he would diverge towards Kosala. They made a quick journey downhill, and it wasn’t long before the dense outline of Naimisharanya proper became visible near the horizon. The Himalaya loomed large behind him, invading their minds and making them look back frequently for glimpses of its grandeur. Near midday, Tritsu finally found Samvarna alone. All day he’d wondered whether to share his thoughts with his father or with the uparajan. Feeling some guilt, he finally decided to talk to Samvarna and not Brhat- reasoning that the uparajan would entertain him more seriously than his own father would. 

“She didn’t tell us anything about Dushyanta,” Tritsu said without preamble.

“I don’t follow,” Samvarna frowned.

“Rajan Maini- she told us everything about Aryavarta and all its clans. But what about Dushyanta, the grand patriarch’s father? She told us he was a king, a conqueror, that Bharata campaigned under his banner. But what banner was that? Was Dushyanta a Suryavanshi? A foreigner? A Puru? A Yadava?”

Samvarna understood, nodding and adding- “She said that if we go far back enough, we would find links to the old tribes.”

“Yes! What do you think that means, uparajan? I noticed that she and Mitrasaha exchanged looks when you talked of Dushyanta.”

“I noticed it too, though I did not think of it the way you do, Tritsu. In fact, I never thought of this at all.” Samvarna had the look of a man who had come upon a realisation. “I never asked about Dushyanta myself, never wondered what tribe he belonged to. I just knew that we were Bharatas, named after the grand patriarch. And even when he talked about Dushyanta, he never told us about Dushyanta’s ancestry. Only now do I find that odd, but this eluded the nine-year-old me.”

“There is something to it,” Tritsu insisted. “Both rajan Maini and Mitrasaha hide something from us.”

“I think you’re right, Tritsu. But don’t let the crown prince sense your suspicion. We need to consult with rajan Ajamidha and the elder paters about all of this.”

“Yes, uparajan,” Tritsu said. 

Mitrasaha’s advance scouts returned in the late afternoon, engaging in tense conversation with the crown prince. When Mitrasaha approached Samvarna his expression was grim. “My scouts report that a contingent of soldiers has been tracking us,” he informed. “They picked up our trail shortly after we left Mithila. At least hundred in number, uparajan.”

Consternation did not show on Samvarna’s face, but he felt it. Counting Mitrasaha and his men they were still a party of less than twenty people. “Do we know who it is?” he asked.

“Yadavas,” Mitrasaha said. “I think they plan to carry out a surprise attack.”

“They scarcely need to,” Samvarana commented grimly. “We’re heavily outnumbered.”

“Indeed,” Mitrasaha agreed. “But we will have to make our stand.”

A look passed between the two warriors- one that only men of sword and blood could. Samvarna called the party to a halt, waiting for the trail to catch up before letting them know the situation- “A Yadava contingent has been following us for some time, their intent is clear.”

“Grtsamada, Aristanemi,” Brhat said, immediately concerned. “Take Vitamsi and ride out. We will hold the Yadavas.”

“No!” Vitamsi protested. “I’m not going anywhere, father.”

Brhat turned to his son for support, but Tritsu knew his sister well. “She will fight with us, father. She can hold her own.”

“We’re not going anywhere either,” Aristanemi said.

That settled it for uparajan Samvarna, who was now in battle mode. His instructions were crisp, his tone curt, leaving no doubt that he was in charge. “There is no point waiting then. Let us take the battle to them. We need to use the element of surprise to our advantage. Crown prince, I need your cavalry at the vanguard. If your riders can seed some chaos early we have a chance.”

Mitrasaha nodded, deferring to Samvarna’s command without protest. The uparajan then turned to his brother. “Brhat- I need you to unleash your heroics today. Maraud through them, show them the strength of your mace. Hold nothing back.” Brhat nodded, his children staring at him anew. They’d never heard much about their father’s battles, but Samvarna’s statement had fired their imagination. 

“Tritsu, you’re with me,” Samvarna said. “We will follow Brhat, protecting his rear. Ketumana and Vitamsi- find their commander. We could get a quick end to the battle if we have his head. Grtsamada, Aristanemi- follow Mitrasaha’s lead, and protect him. I will not have the heir of Ayodhya die on my watch. Is everyone clear?”

They nodded. “Good,” the uparajan said, surveying his fighting force with sharp eyes. “The Yadavas are at least a hundred in number, and this far from their native lands their purpose is clear. This is a fight to the death, Bharatas.”

The Suryavanshi scouts led them off their intended path, turning around and doubling back towards the following Yadavas. An hour later they slowed their pace, and soon came to a halt. The trees were sparse enough here for them to see the clearing ahead, where they spotted the marching contingent of Yadavas. In the front, a single man sat atop the largest bull Tritsu had ever seen. Slowly they sneaked closer to the Yadavas, hidden amid the trees. Closer still, Tritsu saw that the man was of no small build himself, and had a deep scar running across his face. This was clearly the Yadava leader, and the sight of him made Samvarna reassess his plan. “I’ll take him,” he whispered. “Ketumana, Vitamsi- stay with Tritsu and guard Brhat’s rear.” 

They waited a while in the forest as Mitrasaha’s riders circled around to flank the Yadavas from the other side. Then a call broke out and the riders darted from the forest, their loud battle cry sending adrenaline coursing through Tritsu’s veins. Samvarna sprinted, letting out a call of his own, and the Bharatas followed his lead. By the time they emerged from the clearing the Suryavanshi cavalry had done its job. The Yadava contingent was taken by surprise, some of the men even choosing to run at first sight of the enemy. As the Bharatas ran out to the clearing, Tritsu watched in awe as the uparajan was overtaken by a massive, speeding silhouette with a mace- his father Brhat! 

His children had never seen Brhat this way, nor heard of it. But Samvarna had, he knew well what his brother could do on the battlefield. Samvarna was the only one not surprised when Brhat Aijamedhya swung his mace to deadly effect. Bones and skulls were crushed instantly with the power Brhat wielded in his arms and shoulders. 

“Follow him, protect his back,” Samvarna commanded before heading in the direction of the Yadava leader atop his bull. 

Brhat left little for his children to do, no Yadava passing his mace able and uninjured. Tritsu, Vitamsi and Ketumana spread out in a wider arc behind him, clashing their swords with the Yadavas that milled about in the chaos. The Suryavanshi cavalry’s impact was unmistakable. Even now the riders marauded through with speed and lethality, preventing the Yadavas from forming their lines and rallying a proper counterattack. 

Samvarna reached the Yadava leader unassailed, the soldiers even spreading out to let him through. The leader snarled when Samvarna reached him, his bull snorting and stamping its legs ready to charge. “Uparajan Samvarna, leader of the Bharata army,” he said. “You have come to meet your death- I respect that.”

The bull lowered its head, pointing its massive horns at Samvarna. The uparajan started back, unafraid. “Death is certain today,” he said. “But not mine. Will you step down, identify yourself and fight me, Yadava, or would you have me hurt this innocent bull?”

Chaos rained around them but the Yadava laughed. “Oh, I will identify myself for sure! You should know the name of the man who takes your life. I am Mahismata Yadava, rajan of the Haihaya janapada. Bringer of your death, Bharata.”

With that Mahismata charged his bull, but Samvarna was prepared. With an agility that men of his age did not usually display, the uparajan rolled to his left and evaded the charging bull’s horns. He was on his feet before Mahismata turned the beast around, and this time he did not wait for the charge. Even as the bull reared its legs again, Samvarna leapt with his feet targeted at the bull’s head. The beast reacted in instinct, swinging its head to gore Samvarna midair. He evaded and planted his feet firmly between the horns. His attention on Mahismata and the bull, Samvarna did not notice the spear directed at him from a Yadava soldier. As he brought his sword down, aimed directly at Mahismata, the spear behind him was thwarted by a loud clang- Mitrasaha’s flying shield.

Momentarily distracted, Samvarna lost his balance and fell off the bull. Mahismata too was on the ground, having made his attempt to evade Samvarna’s sword by leaning back reflexively. As they got up, both were unable to keep their eyes off the scene that unfolded in front of them. Yadava heads, hands, fingers and other body parts flew in the air, accompanied by tortured screams of the soldiers that met the fury of Mitrasaha’s blade. The Suryavanshi crown prince was a sight to behold, somehow fighting in all directions at once. Yadavas charged at him all around, but he rotated and pivoted with blinding speed. Outside that circle, his riders had now discarded their steeds and joined their prince on the ground. No person that survived the evening would ever forget the sheer prowess of Suryavanshi blades on display. This was a martial legacy started centuries ago, sustained by a proud and regal line of warriors. Grtsamada and Aristanemi held their own, but there was clearly no need for them. The six solar warriors including Mitrasaha took down no less than twenty Yadavas, and on the other side of the battlefield Brhat had maimed almost as many.

Mahismata Yadava surveyed the scene around him in rage, growling for his bull and mounting it with renewed determination. Samvarna braced, ready to jump when the bull came nearer. But it never did. Several paces ahead of Samvarna, two Suryavanshi soldiers thrust out their swords from either side, cleaving into the charging bull’s head. The bull came to near instant stop, its rear quarters rising out of sheer momentum and throwing Mahismata into the air. But to Samvarna’s wide-eyed surprise, the Yadava leader had seen it coming and was ready. He landed on the ground firmly on his feet, his snarl and sword intact. His soldiers formed a line around him, and opposite to them Mitrasaha and his men joined Samvarna, Aristanemi and Grtsamada. The battle had just begun.

None of Tritsu’s cries reached his father. Brhat was deep in blood-rage, only the sound of bones cracking and popping coming to him, pushing him deeper. Tritsu desperately tried to keep up, worrying that his father was pushing himself to recklessness. Something stirred at the other end of the battlefield, attracting the Yadavas and thinning the soldiers around them. Finding a window, Tritsu caught up with his father and shouted from outside the range of his mace. “Father! Snap out of it! Ketumana and Vitamsi have fallen behind, they’re surrounded! We need to go back.”

That reached a corner of Brhat’s perception, his eyes focussing on his son. “Tritsu, my son,” he said, now realising that he was coated in blood- none of it his own. “Go! Go to Vitamsi.”

“Father, we must not separate,” Tritsu pleaded. A group of soldiers approached them now, and Tritsu was losing his window. “Please, father.”

But the sight of the soldiers pulled Brhat back into his daze. “Go,” he insisted, heaving his mace around and facing the approaching party.” He stood wide, tall, proud, and Tritsu had a choice to make. He looked desperately between Brhat and the group of Yadavas around Ketumana and Vitamsi. “I’ll handle this, son,” Brhat said. “Go help your sister.”

Whatever was happening at the other end of the battlefield attracted the bulk of the Yadava force, leaving only six around Ketumana and Vitamsi, who stood defiant, back-to-back. Ketumana found himself smiling despite the situation. Since the Anava attack on Kashi he had imagined fighting alongside Vitamsi, but not like this. Even as he evaded Yadava attacks he had one eye on Vitamsi- not out of concern but admiration. She used her lean size to her advantage, ducking and twisting swiftly as she delivered strategically fatal cuts across throats, thighs and guts. Three Yadavas stood alive by the time Tritsu joined them, and the soldiers now kept wary distance as they reassessed the equation. 

“Where’s your father?” Ketumana asked.

“There,” Tritsu pointed to his right, keeping his eye on the three soldiers. 

“You left him alone?”

“Enough,” Vitamsi barked, making her move. She charged at a Yadava, leaving Tritsu and Ketumana no choice but to do the same. The three young Bharatas made quick work of their opponents, and Vitamsi was already running. “To father!” she shouted, her brother and husband-to-be following. But Brhat had disappeared into the forest, and Tritsu entered the darkness with dread rising inside him. He should have stayed with his father, he knew that now. 

In their sprint, they did not notice that whatever was left of the Yadavas converged around a single point, where Samvarna and Mitrasaha made their final stand. The Bharata uparajan was a warrior par excellence, but even he wondered how this battle might have fared if he did not have the Suryavanshi by his side. Mitrasaha and his men were invincible, their blades blindingly swift, and they strode into enemy lines with no concern for their own lives. Mahismata Yadava observed it too, keeping a count of his dwindling force as he stayed behind, fuming atop his bull. When his contingent of Yadavas was reduced to less than twenty he knew that his stratagem had failed. This day would go to the Bharatas. He gestured silently to the three soldiers around him, making sure not to alert the rest. As the frontline kept the Bharatas and Suryavanshis engaged, Mahismata Yadava beat his retreat, vowing to avenge this humiliation. He disappeared into the forest before Samvarna noticed his absence, and the uparajan was wise enough not to follow in darkness. He did not know, however, that at the other end of the clearing Brhat had done just that- and the young Bharatas had followed.

The Suryavanshi spared no Yadava alive and, save the three that fled with Mahismata, they met their end before the day was over. Samvarna scanned for Brhat and the rest, his expression changing to urgency when he could not spot them. The Bharatas spread around, calling for Brhat, Tritsu, Ketumana and Vitamsi. Samvarna feared the worst, his voice rising with every call. Just as he decided that they would have to search the forest, the figures emerged. It took all three of them to carry Brhat’s body, and even then they struggled. Bold tears streamed down Tritsu’s face, Vitamsi and Ketumana looking equally distraught. Samvarna rushed to them and helped place Brhat’s injured body on the ground.

His chest had been caved in with his own mace, broken ribs sticking out at odd angles. He was still breathing, blood gurgling out in spurts, but he was already beyond saving. “He refused to listen,” Tritsu explained, still sobbing. “I went back to get Vitamsi and Ketumana, he disappeared into the forest.”

“We found him like this,” Ketumana said softly.

“I shouldn’t have left him,” Tritsu said. “I should have stayed.”

Samvarna placed a hand on his nephew’s shoulder. “It’s not your fault, Tritsu.” *It’s my fault*, he thought. He was the one who asked Brhat to unleash himself today, knowing well that Brhat was reckless and unpredictable in that state. And he was the one who set children to defend him. 

They were still three days away from Prayaga, even if they set the fastest pace they could. There was no way Brhat’s body would survive the journey without decay, leaving them with no choice. Brhat Aijamedhya Sauhotri, grandson of Bharata, breath his last in Naimisharanya, surrounded by his helpless son and daughter. He was cremated by the Jahnavi river, his ashes saved to be dispersed in the right place- the confluence at Prayaga.  



**25**

Tritsu performed the funeral duties in a daze, unable to let go of the guilt that threatened to crush him. His father’s death was his fault, and there was no way getting around this fact. Uparajan Samvarna’s command had been simple- protect Brhat’s rear. And Tritsu had failed at that one task. And Vitamsi agreed- whenever he looked to her, her eyes accused silently- *you should have stayed with him*. The only other person Tritsu could really turn to comfort for was his own mother, but she was beyond solace herself. Sunidhi wept in loud heaves, no entreaty for rest or calming reaching her distraught consciousness. 

Rajan Ajamidha was inscrutable throughout, not a single tear spotted on him. But he said nothing, made eye contact with no one. When a ceremonial pyre was lit to represent Brhat’s cremation, Ajamidha stared into the flames for hours, wordlessly. For all his life his brothers Dvimidha and Purumidha had given him support, but even they could bring no comfort today. For what did they know of losing a son, the only child at that. A son that Ajamidha had planned to make rajan soon, retiring himself. A son whose lifeless body Ajamidha could not even bid farewell to, having to settle for a fake pyre. A son who had been dutiful throughout, marrying at the young age of eighteen at his father’s instructions, serving without grudge under uparajan Samvarna. Ajamidha knew already that all will had left him. With his son gone, he wished to have nothing more to do with this world. He would give the rule to Tritsu, or Samvarna, to anyone- but he would rule no more. He had failed in any case. During his reign enemy tribes had grown stronger, strong enough to kill his own son. 

Ajamidha waited for the mock funeral to be over, letting his family find whatever closure this illusory cremation gave to them. Late at night he sent his messengers, calling for key members to assemble in the royal hall. He was waiting there when they began arriving- Dvimidha and Purumidha first, followed by Samvarna, then Tritsu, Kushambha and Nila. 

He felt like giving no preambles. “I am done,” he simply stated. “I don’t want to do this anymore. Who among you does? You decide.”

The Bharatas stared in confusion, Purumidha finally venturing- “What do you mean, dear brother?”

“I will be rajan no more. I am done. Not only is my heart no longer in this, I have clearly failed in my duties. If I could not keep my son safe, I cannot keep the janapada safe. Someone else must step up.”

“That is preposterous,” Dvimidha scoffed, not giving in to Ajamidha’s sombreness. “What happened was not your fault, Aja.”

“It was *my* fault,” Tritsu said, voicing aloud the confession that rang constantly in his head. He turned to Samvarna, explaining- “You commanded me to protect father. You told me to stay at his rear. Had I simply followed your instructions-”

“We might have lost Ketumana or Vitamsi, or both,” Samvarna cut Tritsu off. “You were faced with a choice, Tritsu- as we all are during battle. It does nothing to second-guess yourself. In any case,” Samvarna now turned to his rajan- “This was my fault. I was in command. I directed Brhat to put himself in harm’s way. I failed to protect my men. It is I who should step down, rajan.”

Ajamidha looked tired and in no mood to argue. “You all argue over blame and forget the first part of what I said. My heart is no longer in this. I cannot do it. That alone makes me unfit to be your rajan. All I wish to do is grieve my son in peace.”

For a while no one knew what to say to that. Dvimidha suggested after a while- “After Brhat, Kushambha is next in line.”

“But cousin Samvarna is eldest in my line, father,” Kushambha protested. 

“I have already demonstrated my unsuitability as uparajan. I am the least fit among us to be rajan.”

“The rule has always gone to the eldest of the next line,” Purumidha said, looking to Tritsu. “After brother Aja, Brhat was to be rajan. After Brhat, Tritsu.”

Tritsu frowned, mouth opening to form a protest, but Samvarna cut him off again- “Elder pater Purumidha is right. If rajan Ajamidha is truly to step down, Tritsu is the rightful successor.”

“But I can’t even follow simple orders in battle,” Tritsu said, unable to believe how his elders could suggest this when only a few days ago he had left his father to his death. “Who am I to lead an entire janapada?”

“Tritsu, my child,” the rajan said. “Samvarna has given me a complete account of the battle, and no blame can be assigned to you, son. In the heat of battle, you chose to run for your young cousin and sister- and knowing Brhat I would have done the same. My son was a bull in battle, he wielded his mace like none else could. But he was also reckless, given to overconfidence. Whether you are rajan or not, you need to free yourself of this guilt.”

“But rajan you must be, Tritsu,” Samvarna said, his voice soft. “You have seen battle now. You have seen enemies and allies both. You know what we face. You also know that I stand with you as your loyal general. From the east, your cousin Ketumana will fight alongside you whenever you raise the call. You were to be Bharata rajan one day. Let this be that day.”

“I second the uparajan’s call,” Purumidha said immediately. “Being rajan does not mean you are alone. We stand with you, Tritsu.”

“And you elder paters are not too old yet,” Dvimidha added. “We will ride to battle if you but command us.”

Tritsu looked to his grandfather, not knowing what he was supposed to say to this show of support. Ajamidha nodded at him, knowing the doubts that rankled his grandson’s mind. “Do this only if you are convinced, Tritsu. Not only because you are called to do it. You will be the youngest rajan our janapada has seen, and even the grand patriarch still campaigned for his father at your age. But you also have the largest group of elders and advisors to help you that any rajan has ever had. My brothers may feel young, but I don’t, son. I ask you to relieve me of my duties.”

Tritsuya Barhat had no choice. His elders clearly desired for him to take on the duties of his grandfather- and as the elder Bharata of his line this was his duty. He buried his guilt deep inside him, realising that none else could understand it. Only a few days after he left his father to his death, he ascended to the position of the Bharata rajan. Still the young age of twenty, and the scarred face of Mahismata Yadava imprinted in his memory, he knew that a long road lay ahead of him.



**26**

Ayodhya, the Unconquerable, named so for its king and founder- Ayuddha Manava, king of the Suryavansha, descendant of Manu in the direct line of Adiraja Ikshvaku. At the advanced age of eighty-five, the king looked twenty years younger, and he sat imposingly upon his throne. The throne was carved entirely out of granite but adorned with jewels and gold passed down the Suryavanshi line for generations. The carvings on this throne and the grand pillars of Ayuddha’s hall together told the tale of his people. One showed Adiraja Ikshvaku in battle with Narantaka, the Rakshasa leader- a battle eight hundred years old. Another depicted the great king Prithu as he delivered his famed sermon, and another still portraited the twins Mandhatra and Sravasta in full battle glory. The faces of Vaivasvat Manu, Marici, Maharshis Kashyapa and Vasishtha- all Suryavanshi elder paters- jutted out proudly amid these carvings. 

Here in Ayodhya, Ayuddha had given his people a new home. But everything was designed to harken the glorious past- the days when the solar people were unchallenged in Aryavarta. They’d even named their river *Sarayu*, a tribute to the ancient Harayu that flowed in Dasavarsha- a river that was once Ikshvaku’s final frontier. And the day was not far when Ayuddha would step down and hand it to his son and grandson. The legacy that he’d established would be furthered under their capable reigns, and the Suryavansha would rise strong once again. 

The grandson now stepped into his hall, sending a rush of pride and love through him, as the sight of Mitrasaha always did. The crown prince was a grown man of thirty-three, but Ayuddha still saw the young child who once sat on his lap and begged to hear stories of his ancestors. Mitrasaha’s dishevelled look and the blood on his clothes did not faze Ayuddha. The Suryavanshi king knew his grandson’s abilities well- descended as they were from a long line of brave warriors. 

Ayuddha listened thoughtfully as Mitrasaha gave him the full report, seething at the idea that Yadava soldiers had marched through his realm unchecked. But he saw that his grandson was troubled by something else. “Is that all you wish to tell me?” He asked when Mitrasaha was done.

“That is the full report, yes,” Mitrasaha replied.

“I don’t mean the report, Mitra,” Ayuddha said. “You have your father’s honest eyes- they speak even if you don’t. There is something else you wish to discuss, is there not?”

Mitrasaha nodded. “There is, grandfather. It’s about what rajan Maini told the Bharatas. Or rather, what she specifically didn’t.”

It was easy for Ayuddha to guess the issue. “She did not tell them their full history, making no mention of Dushyanta’s lineage. She did this at my request.”

Mitrasaha made sure to keep his tone respectful. “But why, grandfather? To extend a hand of friendship to the Bharatas and yet conceal such relevant information- is that honourable?”

“Did Maini lie to them? Did they ask her something pointed, and she feign ignorance? What the Bharatas know or do not know about themselves is not our responsibility, Mitra. We will be true to our alliance with them- we will fight alongside them with honour, as you already have.”

Ayuddha could see that his grandson was not convinced but kept silent out of respect. “When we were visited by the Kashi rshi Dhanvantari,” Ayuddha said, “Did he tell us everything? Did he tell us about the rift between the Bharata lines?” Ayuddha did not wait for Mitrasaha to answer- “He did not. But does that make him a dishonourable man? He preserved his tribe’s secrets and gave us honest answers to whatever we asked. What we do now is no different. The Bharatas’ true lineage is a critical piece in Aryavarta’s history, and whoever possesses its knowledge needs to consider how to use it.”

“How could we possibly use that information, grandfather?”

“I don’t know yet,” Ayuddha confessed. “Which is why I requested Maini not to reveal it. But for now, it is in our interest to have all of Aryavarta’s tribes turn on each other. The Pancha Gana consider the Bharatas a natural enemy, and this is good for us.” 



**27**

The elder mater of Kashi did not feel nearly as much remorse for Brhat’s death as her family did. Grtsamada, Aristanemi and Ketumana had lived through the battle- Brhat’s death was both real and regretful. But Kashi did not see it that way. In any case, her concern was more with the marriage that had been set without her consent. 

“The Sauhotris give their daughter away to buy our obedience,” she scoffed, her voice laced with rancour. “And you lot accepted this?”

“It’s not like that, mother,” Grtsamada protested. “The Sauhotris are sincere in their desire for an alliance.” A lot had changed for Grtsamada in the past few weeks. Not only did he know first-hand the danger his people faced, he’d also been confronted with his own ignorance on the very matters he had dedicated his life to. If he was to truly build a Veda- a repository of Aryavarta’s rituals, prayers and knowledge- he could not do so from his isolated chambers in Kashi. 

“An alliance where they assume top position in the hierarchy,” Kashi said, unconvinced. “Ketumana will be lucky even to retain his title as uparajan.”

“Why did father and grandfather really rebel, aunt Kashi?” Aristanemi asked, feeling tired of having the same argument with Kashi again and again.

Kashi was momentarily thrown off her poise. “What do you mean?”

“From everything you’ve told us, grandfather wanted to keep this city- that was his only desire. He rebelled so that Kashi would stay with us.”

“Yes, that’s why he rebelled.” Kashi was unsure where Aristanemi was going with this.

“So he did not rebel because he wanted to be rajan after Bharata,” Aristanemi concluded aloud. “Or because he wanted you or my father to be rajan one day.”

Kashi looked confused. “No, that was never Sunahotra’s ambition.”

“Then why is your ambition now, aunt Kashi? If Sunahotra was okay with his elder brother assuming top position in the hierarchy as long as he retained Kashi, why are we not okay with a similar arrangement now? Or does your ambition exceed grandfather’s?”

“Do not speak to me in that tone, Nemi!” Kashi stared at her nephew furiously, unable to believe that he dared challenge her in this manner. “One trip to Prayaga and you think you understand this better than I do? For years after Bharata’s death Ajamidha and the others tried to corner us. They disallowed boats to ply down the Ganga to this city, they stopped all trade, leaving us to fend for ourselves. Only I know what it took to keep you boys and this city safe.”

Aristanemi lowered his gaze, realising the truth of Kashi’s words. Ketumana went and sat by his grandmother’s feet, gently brushing them with his hands. “None of us can imagine what those years would have been like,” he said softly. “Especially after my father abdicated his duties and left you alone all over again. But are not alone anymore, grandmother. Your family stands strong now, ever dedicated to you and this city. But we *have *to get past our rivalry with the Sauhotris, there is no other way. I personally fought the Yadavas- I saw their commander. If the Anava attack wasn’t enough, I know even better now what we face. We need the Sauhotris. *I *need the Sauhotris. I have seen Tritsu and uparajan Samvarna in battle. I have seen our Suryavanshi ally with the sword. We want such strength on our side.”

Kashi seemed to relax after Ketumana’s gentle, sincere entreaty, eyes still darting to Aristanemi. She brushed Ketumana’s hair, remembering the time when he was but an infant left to her care by his father, who had fathered him only to satisfy her in the first place. Dhanvantari had no desire to be rajan after her. He wanted nothing to do with rule and janapada, and so Kashi had given him a condition. If he would father an heir, she would let him leave Kashi to pursue his own goals. It was a tragic circumstance to bring a young life into, but Kashi had no other choice. Her younger son Grtsamada was already taken more to ritual than to rule, and the nephew Aristanemi was an aloof, disrespectful boy throughout his life. Ketumana had been Kashi’s only hope, as he still was. “And they need your strength in battle, my son,” she explained to him. “Kashi is their way to keep their back covered- from the Anavas- leaving them free to expand westward. You want this alliance, go ahead and make it. But never forget that they could just as easily be using us. And one day you may have to fight for this city, just like your ancestors once did.”

That seemed to settle the matter for now, Kashi not so much as agreeing to the alliance as relenting to it. This said nothing on what she thought about the marriage though, and Ketumana was too self-conscious to bring this up himself. He looked to his uncles hoping they could help, but Grtsamada was on a different track- “I learnt some other things at Mithila,” he said, eyes twinkling. “Things that can help me in my work.”

“Oh,” Kashi raised her eyebrows, intrigued. “You mean to build the Veda?”

“Yes, mother. You remember how you used to hit me with a stick if I forgot the prayers?”

“I do.”

“Well I thank you for that now, because it helped stick them to my memory. But rajan Maini taught me a technique known as the anukramani- a way to index prayers such that they can be committed to memory much easier. The Janakas already have dozens of anukramanis, indexing a lot of the early Vasishtha and Kashyapa prayers.”

The hint of a smile finally creaked upon Kashi’s wrinkled face. “Does this mean you can build the Veda quicker now?” She’d been disappointed when Grtsamada had declared his interests, having already lost Dhanvantari to other pursuits. But in the years since then she’d grown proud of Grtsamada’s work, even developing a close interest in it.

“I think so,” Grtsamada ventured. “I have to build an anukramani for the prayers I know to see if it works. But there’s another thing…”

“What?”

“I’ll need to travel, mother. Especially to Ayodhya. I need to visit the Vasishtha rshis there and learn from them.”

Kashi sighed. “Strange how despite not growing up around him, you’re so much like your brother,” she said in a defeated tone. “I can’t stop any of you once your minds are made up, can I?” She turned to Aristanemi- “And I suppose you’re going too?”

“No,” Aristanemi said instantly, no longer confused about what he wanted to do in life. He’d seen battle first-hand now. He’d seen the threat his people faced, and Brhat’s death brought the threat closer than he could ever imagine. Kashi still held on to a broken past, and Grtsamada cared not for such things now that he’d found renewed direction. But Aristanemi knew what was more important- war had come to them, fully armed and ready. And he would join his Bharata brethren in responding.

The Yamuna flowed with full ferocity here, uninterrupted in an almost straight line once it emerged from the Khandakvana a couple of days upstream. It was a deep river, and as its waters gushed past here one could imagine the damage it could wield if it flooded or changed course. Finding the location hadn’t been too difficult for Darsana. Several days ago he’d picked up unmistakable trails of caravans, convoys and soldier marching parties- all leading to the same place. A part of him approached with pure intellectual curiosity, for this was an opportunity to witness a settlement in its originating stages. Only a few years ago this site was barren, no human inhabitation for yojanas around. Now the place bustled with activity, construction on at a frantic pace all around. The mildly unpleasant stench of cow-dung hung in the air, fresh droppings dotting the hastily constructed pathways.

Darsana spotted a quite a few foreigners in the streets, traders no doubt. There were fair-skinned and blue-eyed Yavanas, sallow-skinned and brown-eyed Dasas, and even a few dark-skinned and frizzy-haired Avarikas roaming curiously in the busy markets. But the settlement had an undeniable Yadava air nonetheless. Closer to the river bank Darsana spotted young boys and girls frolicking in a sexual abandon not known in the otherwise puritan Aryavarta- clear signs that Yadava morality, or amorality, held sway here. At the primary ghat he saw the statue- shining bright in bronze and copper colours. The muscles were not well detailed, but great and elaborate horns jutted out of the ram’s head- symbol of the great Vrishna clan. Mathu Yadava may have named the town after himself, but this statue was a clear exaltation of his father’s name.

The Town of Mathu, or Mathura then, was a demonstration of what a newly settled, still disorganised mix of humanity could look like. Its cluttered streets were in sharp contrast to Mulyasthana’s planned grid, and already there were signs that Mathu Yadava did not care for waste management nearly as much as the council of elders at Mulyasthana did. Along the Yamuna’s banks Darsana saw people discarding waste only a few steps upstream of others bathing their cattle, still upstream of devotees immersing themselves in the river uncaring of the garbage flowing towards them. Darsana had spent a lifetime travelling in Aryavarta and beyond, but at this sight he chuckled out of sheer nostalgia. Only in Aryavarta proper, his own homeland, would he find such scenes- pure apathy existing alongside sincere and unshaking devotion. 

It took a while before the guard returned, announcing that Mathu Yadava would grant Darsana audience after all. Darsana knew that the sight that greeted him when he entered was connived to offend his sensibilities. Mathu Yadava sat on a couch surrounded by four consorts, each dressed in flimsy attire that left nothing to imagination. Two of them stroked Mathu suggestively, their eyes sharpening at Darsana as he entered. He needed no conscious exertion to ignore the bawdy display, mind trained by years of voluntary celibacy. In any case, Mathu loved to provoke, and for many years Darsana had lived with that provocation. 

“My eyes see it, but my mind refuses to believe it!” Mathu commented as Darsana approached. “The loyal servant returns, if he ever was that to begin with.”

Darsana ignored the barb and bowed, reassuring himself that he only bowed to Vrishna’s son and rightful successor. “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t loyal.”

“Surely,” Mathu said sarcastically. “But loyal to whom? That is the question. You are sent here by my father, no doubt?”

“I am, but my loyalty is to the Yadava clan.”

“So you say, but I’m not so sure. Where have you been all these years, Darsana?”

“Travelling, both in and beyond Aryavarta. Most recently, I am returned from Gandhara.”

“Ah, home to a cousin of mine, I believe.”

Darsana nodded. “A Druhyu, yes.”

“What brings you back then?”

“Loyalty. I heard of trouble between us and the Bharatas, and I wanted to help my people.”

Mathu Yadava gestured for his consorts to leave them, scrutinising Darsana with narrowed eyes. He’d never liked the man, but he grudgingly accepted that Darsana was a capable soldier. For years he’d served Mathu’s father loyally, instrumental in helping set the Vrishni clan’s base that Mathu now expanded on. Except Mathu had never really known the nature of Darsana’s service. Vrishna used Darsana more as a spy than a common soldier- often sending him on secretive intelligence collection missions.

“What help can you give?” Mathu asked, mildly curious. “You are no infantry-man, nor a war commander of any repute. What you did for my father remained between the two of you.”

“I know you better than that, rajan,” Darsana said. “Nothing remains a secret from you for too long. Surely you know some of the work I did. I am well versed with Aryavarta’s geography, economy and politics. I know the cities, I have contacts, and I know the major rulers. I can be wherever you need me to be, gathering relevant information.”

Mathu pondered over that, reminding himself that Darsana’s true loyalty was only to Vrishna. “There is somewhere I need you to be,” he admitted, still thinking it over. “My uncle Mahismata recently mounted an attack on a Bharata travelling party, and was nearly successful too.”

Darsana suppressed his reaction, overcoming the impulse to ask what happened in the attack. Aloud he commented impassively- “Rajan Mahismata’s war prowess is well known.”

“Yes, but not the Suryavansha’s. Not anymore,” Mathu said. “Mahismata would have killed every Bharata in that party were it not for six Suryavanshi soldiers. *Merely six!*  I know they were a capable martial tribe once, but surely they are a shadow of that now?”

Darsana knew how wrong that assumption was. “The Suryavansha were, and still might be, Aryavarta’s most martial people. Their horse cavalries are unparalleled, and even if they live in the forest now they would not have lost their character. What happened in the attack, rajan?”

“We were successful in one thing at least. The Bharata called Brhat lost his life in the attack.”

It now took all of Darsana’s training and control to hide emotion from his face. “If that is true, then war has begun,” he commented. “Brhat was the Bharata rajan’s son- in the primary line of Bharata himself. Their people will retaliate.”

“And I am prepared for that,” Mathu said, unfazed. “But the only variable here is the Suryavansha. If six of their men could thwart someone like Mahismata, then I am worried. I need you to go to Ayodhya, Darsana. Study the city, ascertain their strength. If they ride to war alongside the Bharatas, I need to know what they are capable of.”

Darsana nodded in acknowledgment, not sharing that he could not go to Ayodhya. His cover in that city was blown a long time ago, but Mathu’s directive served Darsana’s own purpose well. He would go to Suryavanshi lands, but not to their capital. He would go to the older city, the one where he still had friends- Sravasti.



**29**

Kampilya- the Scented One. Established on the Ganga by rajan Bharata, it was settled as a sister city to Kanyakubja. The land here was ripe with the same kubjaka rose that gave Kanyakubja its name, and enamoured with its scent, the grand patriarch had given Kampilya its name. Kampilya marked the Bharata janapada’s north-west frontier, giving it the character of a military outpost over an inhabited city. But watch at the outpost had thinned in the decades since Bharata’s death, leaving it open to the Yadava attack 3 months ago. Uparajan Samvarna had taken it back soon after, and the outpost was thinly manned no more. The full potential of the Bharata army could now be gauged from the military presence here. Twelve elephant cavalry contingents had been pushed out from Prayaga, their constant blares sending loud warnings to any enemy presence nearby. Elaborate traps surrounded the outpost, both archers and infantry garrisoned in trenches behind them. The Bharata war machinery had switched on after many decades, and they were no longer going to wait for the battles to come to them.

Ekachakra was only a day’s march south from here. The old Yadava capital was not an inhabited city anymore, but scouts had confirmed the presence of Yadava barracks at the old site as well as trails leading north of it- along the Yamuna’s western bank. Faced with this information, and the desire to avenge his father’s death burning within him, rajan Tritsu had to plan his next move. 

“If we set a hard pace, we can make the journey to Ekachakra in half a day,” Samvarna said. “We can be there by nightfall if you command it, my rajan.”

Tritsu tsked. “That feels wrong, uncle. Your experience, wisdom and age far exceed my own for you to call me your rajan.”

“But that’s what you *are*, Tritsu. And it does no good to second-guess your stature now. In an ideal world your grandfather would have ruled for many more years and your father after that. But our world was never ideal, and whatever idyllic existence we wished to live is no longer possible.”

“How can you accept that with such ease?” Tritsu asked, still not convinced. “You are born to the grand patriarch’s eldest line. Why should you not be rajan?”

Samvarna chuckled. “You say that as if the eldest progeny’ sex never mattered. Save a few exceptions, leadership in Aryavarta has always passed from father to son. But I do not begrudge that. Everyone is born into their own duty, their own purpose.”

That still didn’t explain Samvarna’s stoic attitude. “But that’s not how it works in Kashi,” Tritsu pressed. “After Sunahotra and Shala’s death, elder mater Kashi should have only been a temporary regent. If rule passes from father to son, it should now descend to Aristanemi and not Ketumana.”

Samvarna nodded, acknowledging Tritsu’s point- “Something that would have created much problems in Kashi, if Aristanemi even remotely thought like that. But he doesn’t, which teaches us that there is little point to imagine worries and spend time over them, nephew. I understand your uncertainties, I remember being twenty once, not too long ago. And whatever wisdom or experience you credit me with is here at your service, at the janapada’s service.”

Tritsu took a deep breath, feeling older than his years. “Not everyone is as noble as you, uncle. And therein lies Aryavarta’s problem. Everyone wants to be a king, everyone wants this land to belong to their people alone. There has to be a fix to this.”

Samvarna stared at his nephew, wondering what other doubts plagued his young mind. “Maybe there is,” he offered. “And if so, we’ll find it. One step at a time, rajan.”

Tritsu’s demeanour changed, a decisive air coming upon him. “What about the trail that leads north of Ekachakra? Where do you think that leads?”

“Mathu Yadava has been campaigning along the Yamuna for years. No doubt he’s set up camps and villages by the river. I think the trail leads to some kind of new settlement.”

“Should we investigate?”

“Scouts are already on the way, my rajan.”

“So we focus on Ekachakra for now?”

“That would be my suggestion. Arriving at Ekachakra by nightfall will be good. We can catch them by surprise and use the darkness to our advantage.”

“But what about the elephants? Can they keep up with us?”

“No, they will be slower- catching up only by sunrise tomorrow. But that is good, rajan. Elephants are of little use at night, easily scared and unwilling to really fight. Besides, it is difficult to be stealthy when marching with them. We can arrive at Ekachakra with a vanguard by tonight. If the Yadavas put up a resistance, if the battle rages till dawn- then the elephants can join us.”

Tritsu nodded, grateful for his uparajan’s experience. “Let us be on then,” he said, gearing up to lead his first Bharata battle.

**30**

Vidarbha Yadava’s sleep was interrupted by the shouts of men, screaming for people to take cover. He was out of his bed in an instant, his sword in grip. Wrapped only his loincloth, he emerged out of his tent to find the camp in chaos. Flaming arrows rained from the sky, and in the distance he could see enemy soldiers engaging his own in hand-to-hand combat. Instinct alone told Vidarbha what he needed to know. Realising that his camp was under attack, he concluded swiftly that it could only be the Bharatas. They had strengthened their position in Kampilya over the past few weeks, and it was only a matter of time before they sought revenge for Brhat’s death. 

He shouted above the din, calling for his men to rally around him. His initial shock subsiding, anger and pride now took over. This was Ekachakra- home of his ancestors. It had been desecrated once before, by Suryavanshi soldiers, and Vidarbha’s people only now thought of settling it again. He wasn’t going to let these Bharatas thwart those plans. He marshalled his army into a competent defense, gaining some control over the battle after the initial chaos. But it was clear that the Bharatas had come here with nothing held back. Wave after wave of arrows continued to dog the Yadavas, and Bharata infantry had now infiltrated the garrison completely. 

Vidarbha lost track of how long he fought, leading from the front as he showed Bharata soldiers the lethality of his blade. Once, amid the flames, he spotted a young, handsome face among the Bharatas, men rallying around him as if he was some leader. But some distance away another important-looking Bharata commanded men from his horse, his bearing proud and gaze sharp. Vidarbha could not be sure, but it felt as if these were the leaders- members of the core clan. Vidarbha gritted his teeth in frustration, knowing that there was no way he could get close to either of them in this chaos. Fatigue set in him as the battle wore on, and the flaming tents around him suggested that Ekachakra was already lost. But it was close to dawn now and the Bharata forced had thinned. If Vidarbha and his men could hold out for a few hours more, they might be able to break the Bharata resolve.

That was when he heard the calls. It was a single elephant first, loud and blaring. Then it was picked up by countless more- the unmistakable cry of a herd. As the sun poked its head above the horizon and cast its first rays of the day, it made visible the hundreds of elephants marching towards them. At the sight of them all resolve finally left Vidarbha- there was no way they could keep this up against the might of Bharata elephant cavalries. Vidarbha Yadava was proud, but he was no fool. Promising himself that he would return to retake Ekachakra, he beat a hasty retreat- making sure to keep the Bharatas engaged as he sneaked away from the battle and to the north, towards the rest of his clan. 

“There! I see him!” Samvarna shouted, ready this time. He wasn’t going to let another Yadava leader flee the scene of battle.

“No!” Tritsu shouted, carrying a different intent. “Let him go, uncle. Let him run to the rest and tell them what happened here.”

Samvarna struggled, torn between the sight of a fleeing Yadava and his rajan’s command.

“I need your help here, uparajan,” Tritsu insisted, gesturing for soldiers to form a protective circle around the burning camp. “Help me round up the Yadava survivors.”

Like Mahismata Yadava had in Naimisharanya, the Yadava leader of Ekachakra fled leaving the bulk of his surviving force behind- at the mercy of Bharata blades. Tritsu gave mercifully swift deaths to the injured, but the rest he gathered as captives. More than a thousand Yadavas had been garrisoned here a night before, but less than a hundred survived. They laid down their arms when their leader fled and the Bharatas had them surrounded, looking balefully at the young Bharata leader that assessed them.

“What is your name, Yadava soldier?” Tritsu asked of the soldier staring back at him.

“I am Dhriti Yadava,” he said, tone defiant.

“And have you always been a soldier?”

Dhriti frowned, unsure where this line of questioning was going.

“Were you born into the warrior’s life, or did you take up the sword later?” Tritsu asked.

Dhriti’s gaze finally faltered as he looked down in memory. “I was a cowherd once.”

“And where is your herd now?”

Dhriti looked up, the defiance back in his eyes. “I am a warrior now.”

Tritsu nodded, eyes full of understanding. He gestured around, now making out the feeble remnants of huts and other buildings amid the tents- “This was Ekachakra once, wasn’t it? Is this the land of your forefathers?”

“Always was,” the soldier next to Dhriti piped up. “Always will be.”

Tritsu made an exaggerated show of being hurt. “And my conquest today means nothing?”

“Our rajan will return,” the soldier asserted. “Flee now or be crushed under his vengeance.”

“You mean the rajan who left you here to die?” Samvarna taunted. “What is his name anyway? I would hope that wasn’t the famed Mathu Yadava, and I have met Mahismata. So perhaps that was Vidarbha?”

The silence confirmed Samvarna’s guess. “I have no doubt that Vidarbha Yadava will return,” Tritsu said. “And say he succeeds in taking it. Say Ekachakra is a Yadava town once again.” He looked directly at the soldier next to Dhriti, locking him with his gaze- “What then, Yadava soldier? You mount an attack on Kampilya, right? Or Kanyakubja maybe?”

“Aggression is met with aggression, yes.”

“Yet our attack today is but retaliation for the past attack on Kampilya.”

“Itself revenge for the aggressions of your late patriarch,” the soldier immediately countered.

“Ah yes,” Tritsu said, smiling. “The old cycle of conquest, aggression and retaliation. That’s what I want to talk to you all about today. I respect Yadava history- I do. Just as much as I respect all of Aryavarta’s history. And Aryavarta is not the land of a single janapada- it is the land of many janapadas. I think there is enough space here for all of us. What do you think, brave soldier?”

The soldier turned to Dhriti, uncertain. “Do not bore us with your sermons, Bharata,” Dhriti grunted, uttering the name as if a curse. “We are your captives. Do with us what you wish- as is your right.”

“But all I wish to do is talk,” Tritsu said, trying to ignore the curious looks he received from Samvarna. A theory long fomented in his mind, and today Tritsu wanted to test it.

“What if I retreat from Ekachakra,” he said. “Would your leaders make a treaty of non-violence? No Yadavas attack Kampilya from here on, and no Bharatas attack Ekachakra. This ancient city, settled along a sacred confluence much like my own capital is, belongs to your people.”

Dhriti’s defiant stare broke for a second time as he assessed Tritsu’s offer, eyebrows narrowing in suspicion. 

“I know you are not the man to speak on behalf of Yadavas,” Tritsu said. “But I want to know what you think nevertheless. I want to know what all of you think. I know that many of you are not warriors by birth, and many still don’t want to do this till the end of their life. My own tribe lived in blissful ignorance till your janapada’s attack on Kampilya. How do we end this? How do we break the cycle?”

“You need not speak on your tribe’s behalf, Dhriti Yadava,” Tritsu pressed. “Speak for yourself. What way do you see to end this?”

That finally broke through, and the man who replied was not the defiant soldier but a nostalgic cowherd. “Peace,” he said, sounding wistful. “Peace is the way. But who would have it?”

“I would,” Tritsu declared without missing a beat. 

The soldier next to Dhriti scoffed. “That comes from a man who just laid our camp to waste.”

“What is your name, Yadava?” Tritsu asked, unoffended. 

“He is my brother,” Dhriti said. “Sudhriti Yadava.”

“Your brother is not wrong,” Tritsu conceded, again working hard to ignore the obvious stares he got from Samvarna. “It is always easy to talk of peace after a conquest. But ask yourselves why the retaliation on Ekachakra came only today. Your people attacked Kampilya more than six months ago- why did we wait till now?” Tritsu did not wait for a response- “We were not waiting in the first place. We retook Kampilya and would have considered it the end of that. But only two weeks ago your people attacked us again, in Naimisharanya. I lost my father in that battle, and that is when we decided to sit back no more. So you see, Dhriti, Sudhriti and all you brave Yadavas- war begets war. It never ends.”

“Leave Ekachakra alone and we will see,” Sudhriti said, unmoved.

“I intend to do just that,” Tritsu said. Beside him, it took all of Samvarna’s training and restrain to not speak out. There was a time and place to question his rajan, but it was not in front of enemy soldiers. He listened with disbelieving ears as Tritsu declared his full intent- “Ekachakra is yours, as it always has been. I respect that, and I will expect your respect in return. I leave all of the Yamuna to you, and you will leave the Ganga to me. I know your leaders will not rest after hearing this. The war that has now started will take some time before settling- but I speak only to you men here. Tell your brethren that the Bharatas have no quarrel with the Yadavas. But with this attack today we’ve also shown that we are not a weak tribe. We will fight fire with fire- if that is your desire.”

He let the Yadava captives go after that, shaking cordial hands with Dhriti and his still suspicious brother. Then he did what he knew he had to- explain himself to his uparajan. 

“Forgive me, uncle,” Tritsu said. “I know I should have discussed this with you before. But I wanted to try something today.”

Samvarna maintained his composure. “You are never to apologise to me, rajan.”

“But I am the younger, the inexperienced. I must at least explain myself to you. I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, uncle, and I know that janapada supremacy is not the way forward. Each tribe in Aryavarta thinks itself to have a legitimate claim to ultimate rule. The same rivalries play out again and again, resurgent over generations. But we are all of this land, we all hold equal claim to it. A peaceful future is only one where we negotiate a shared existence.”

It was the sort of pacifism that had come naturally to Samvarna when he was younger. But years of war had taught him different. “That’s a noble vision,” he admitted. “But the other tribes do not think this way, rajan.”

“I know,” Tritsu said. “That’s why today was an experiment. I wanted to know how the common men of Aryavarta think. The men who’d rather tend to cattle than take the sword.”

“What good does that do?” Samvarna asked, frowning. “The same men would follow their Yadava commanders without question. As long as the commanders have grander ambitions, there can be no peace.” 

“Exactly,” Tritsu said, eyes gleaming. “It tells us how severe we must be, uncle. We only need to get the heads- the ambitious commanders you speak of. The common soldiers may yet see things the same way as I do.”

“Now come, uparajan,” Tritsu pressed. “Outer battles are not the only thing we must tackle. There is still the matter of sealing our internal rift. There’s a wedding to conduct, and we will go to elder mater Kashi ourselves to convince her.”

Samvarna nodded, face breaking into a reluctant but proud smile. His young nephew was growing up and taking charge- just what the janapada needed now.

“The more I know, the more I realise I don’t know,” Grtsamada lamented. “Every new thing I learn throws light on more ignorance. What the Janakas alone know will take years to assimilate.”

Aristanemi felt he understood. He’d been there when rajan Maini told Grtsamada of the idea of an anukramani, and that wasn’t all she’d told them. “It’s the work of a lifetime, brother,” he said.

“Or maybe more,” Grtsamada said. “The greatest contributions to the Veda have come not from individuals but from pairs- of either father or son, or guru and shishya. Maharshi Vasishtha’s Nasadiya Sukta was completed by his student, and the Puru rshi Kanva worked together with his son Medhatithi. I’ve been entrenched in my corner too long, Nemi. I have neither the student nor the son.”

Aristanemi saw where this was going. “So you’re firm in your decision to go to Ayodhya?”

“What choice do I have? I must meet with the Vasishtha rshis and learn more.”

“But what of everything you already know? You said it yourself- the more you’ll learn, the more you’ll realise there’s more to learn. That journey will never end, but that shouldn’t stop you from beginning your work in earnest.”

“Where do I start? What do I address first?” Grtsamada was helpless. 

“You could begin with establishing an order,” Aristanemi suggested. “Should the prayers be grouped according to the deity they’re addressed to, or according to the rshi that composed them? Should earlier prayers come first? And what prayers to keep, what do discard?” He realised as he said this that Grtsamada’s project was in many ways his own as well. He’d grown up alongside it, being a part of Grtsamada’s learnings and wonderings. Unconsciously, he’d been thinking about these things too.

Grtsamada’s response was not what he expected- “I think I need to get married.”

Aristanemi’s eyebrows raised in curiosity. Grtsamada explained- “We just agreed- this is the work of a lifetime or even more. I cannot do this alone, and even if I start now I cannot complete it. There are no rshi schools in Kashi, and I never took on a disciple. If this work has to continue after me, only a son can take it forward.”

Aristanemi couldn’t help but chuckle. “That’s an interesting line of reasoning, brother,” he teased. “Even if you marry tomorrow and waste no time, it will be at least ten years before you have the assistant you want.”

“Enough time to get started along the path you just prescribed,” Grtsamada said, ignoring Aristanemi’s teasing tone. “It’s time I begin giving shape to the Veda, organising and classifying the prayers in a meaningful way. And you will help me, will you not?”

“Only as much as I can,” Aristanemi said honestly. “Our people have pressing needs as this time, brother, as you well know. We can no longer ignore the war at our doorstep.”

Grtsamada assessed his cousin with thoughtful eyes. “I’ve seen you in battle,” he said. “You have a way about you, a natural warrior’s way.” 

Aristanemi shrugged. “They tell me that’s what my father and grandfather were.”



**32**

Hastina Puru tried to contain his anger, his eyes seething nevertheless. “A thousand soldiers wiped out in one night! And this after that failed attack you tried in Naimisharanya.”

“*Failed* attack?” Mahismata repeated. “You call taking the life of that Bharata scion, Brhat, and bringing an early retirement to his father a failure?”

“If I remember correctly, you set out to eradicate their entire leadership, did you not?” Hastina countered. “Tactics, speed, lethality- these were the things you said you could muster. Multiple retreats are not a part of these.”

Mathu Yadava placed a hand on Mahismata to keep him from responding, his own eyes gazing calmly back at Hastina. “And what has the great Puru king been doing in this time, not counting that feeble attempt you made to wipe out the Kashi line?”

“Working on the plan you were too arrogant to hear out last time!” Hastina replied defiantly. “We’re not going to win against the Bharatas with petty guerilla attacks. We need to pit our full strength against them, and for that we have to build strength first.”

“Go on,” Mahismata goaded.

“Open war with the Bharatas will involve their elephant contingents- we need elephants of our own. Their Suryavanshi alliance means they’ll be backed by elite horse cavalries, so I’ve been importing horses from the far north and acclimatising them here. We’ll need metals for weapons, shields and armour, and metal doesn’t come cheap or easy. We’ll need functioning transport lines and sufficient grain reserves. That’s what I’ve been working on all this while.”

Mahismata still stared menacingly, but Mathu Yadava appraised Hastina anew. “That’s quite a preparation, Puru king,” he admitted.

“It’s what I’ve been trying to tell you,” Hastina said, voice rising louder than he intended for it to. “Random raids on unprotected villages and towns are one thing, all out war against the Bharatas and Suryavansha is another thing altogether. It needs military strategy that you do not possess.”

“And you do, obviously,” Mahismata drawled.

Hastina gave the Yadavas a confident smile. “I am Hastina Puru,” he reminded them. “Born in the line of Pravira, son of Puru, I was taught and raised by my clan elders. I have lived for this war, dear Yadavas. Wiping the Bharatas out has been my life’s mission, and I will do so with or without your assistance.”

“A bold claim, Hastina Puru,” Mathu said, unimpressed by the bravado. “But as you well know now, taking on the Bharatas means taking on the Suryavansha as well. You will not be able to do this alone. And so we will assist you. What would you have the Yadavas do?”

Hastina nodded, accepting the endorsement. Then he turned to Mahismata.

“Well,” the Yadava said. “Go on then, Puru king.”

“The Bharatas beat you at Ekachakra but retreated,” Hastina observed. “That’s interesting, because it shows they’re unwilling to spread themselves thin. We need to force them out, engaging them on multiple fronts. From here, you can mount an attack on Kampilya or Kanyakubja both- but that’s what they will expect. Between Kanyakubja and Prayaga, along the Ganga on either side, lie several smaller Bharata villages. You can attack them with your special skills for raiding and pillaging, while I press a force down from Ahikshetra. Let us split their armies and leadership and see how they perform.”

“And the Anavas press from the east, right?” There was a curious twinkle in Mahismata’s eyes when he asked that.

“I don’t intend to play that hand just yet,” Hastina lied, uncomfortable under Mahismata’s stare. 

Still feeling chastened after his defeat at Ekachakra, Vidarbha Yadava had kept silent so far. But now he spoke up- “So after your sermon about all out war, you still want us raiding petty villages and nothing more?”

“Yes, but this time it’s to a plan. Your raid will not be meaningless. While you divert the Bharata attention, my forces will press down on Kampilya. This time we will take the outpost to keep it.”

“You mean *you* will take the outpost, and *you *will keep it. While we raid a few villages and then what, return home?” Vidarbha challenged.

Hastina Puru had expected that, though he thought it would come from Mahismata. He had a larger vision in mind, and for that he was prepared to make small concessions. “You can return to Kampilya and claim it as your own,” he offered. “Will that do, dear Vidarbha?”

Vidarbha frowned, not knowing what to make of Hastina’s gesture. “We have no interest in the Ganga,” Mathu said, “Save for where it meets the Yamuna. You can keep Kampilya.” To himself he added- *for now*.

Hastina nodded, satisfied. “So be it then, thus begins the first wave of our war. I will have my aide Mantim co-ordinate the schedules with you. We begin within the fortnight.”

Mathu returned the nod, extending his hand to clasp Hastina’s in a gesture of alliance. As he departed, Hastina looked to the buzz of construction and activity around them. “This will grow to be a fine town,” he said. “And Mathura- a fine name too.”

Mathu chuckled. “Short for Mathupura, of course. My people are given to a more casual language than high Sanskrit.”

“Mathupura or Mathura, either way, I like it.” As he departed, Hastina allowed himself to imagine something similar.

Mahismata challenged his nephew the moment Hastina was out of earshot- “We’re really going to follow this Puru’s leadership?”

Mathu did not rise to the tone. “For now, yes.”

“He lies to us, you know.”

“What do you mean, uncle?”

Mahismata scoffed dismissively. “He has no alliance with the Anavas! You think I haven’t been in touch with Bali myself? Hastina met his sons, yes, but they refused to help him.”

Mathu’s eyes narrowed menacingly, now making him look like his uncle. “And you tell me this now?”

Mahismata was unfazed by the stare. “There is a time for everything. Besides, I didn’t think you’d bend over like this for a Puru.”

Mathu Yadava was not a man to lose his temper, but he exhaled sharply. “I think you confuse it with what you did in the forest, faced with just six Suryavanshis.”

“Careful now, nephew, or I will forget whose son you are.”

“Stop it, both of you,” Vidarbha said, physically stepping in between his cousin and nephew. But Mathu and Mahismata continued to stare each other down, Mathu’s eyes almost daring Mahismata to do something. Vidarbha gently pushed his nephew away and turned to Mahismata. “You should have told us, Mahi. That was the agreement we struck- no secrets between us.”

“Fine,” Mahismata barked, breaking his stare and backing off. “I should have told you, but you should also remember that I answer to neither of you. I will play with Hastina for now, just as you want. But I will not remain subservient to him for longer than I like.” There was still tension in the air when they broke bread together that night, and Vrishna’s words came back to Mathu- *You may think him an ally, my son, but Mahismata is loyal only to himself. Be wary, and do not trust him blindly.*



**33**

Last night’s rain had cleared the skies, making for a bright, sunny day. If Darsana squinted hard, he could make out the Himalayan foothills at the horizon. Harder still, he could even imagine spotting a peak or two, their outlines almost fading into the background. But around him was flat, fertile and river-fed ground. The Naimisharanya had been cleared in a swathe that extended for yojanas in every direction. But the fecund smell of lush forest still hung in the air, mixed with the petrichor of last night’s rain. It was humid but not stifling, cool river breeze making for a fresh morning. In another month the monsoon would set in completely, and the Sarayu river would swell to almost double its width. The residents here were used to the seasonal flooding, and most of their permanent constructions were some distance away from the bank. The first time Darsana had come here, he’d guessed the Sarayu’s fickle nature just by looking at the granite ghats- covered in the sort of soggy moss that came only after prolonged submergence under water. He’d wagered to his host then that the dry ghats away from the bank would have no such moss, and won for himself access to the settlement’s ancient repository of scrolls, tablets, beads, pots and other cultural assortments.

“The last time you were here,” the host now joked, “We feared you’d never leave. But when you finally did, we’d hoped you wouldn’t return.”

Darsana smiled. “I didn’t realise I was that much of a nuisance.”

“That much and more, I assure you.”

“Well, too bad. You didn’t really think I’d be satisfied with just one visit, did you, Anaranya? Even if it did last three years.”

“No, not when I really thought about it,” Anaranya admitted. “Sravasti has that effect on people.”

“It truly does,” Darsana agreed, looking around to absorb Sravasti’s serene air. This was a city more than two hundred and fifty years old, and on his first visit Darsana had learnt the full history. Established by Sravasta, one half of the famed Suryavanshi twin kings, it was founded as their tribe’s first home on the Gangetic plains. To them this was a land of rebirth, a new home for an ancient people that once flourished along the Sindhu and Sarasvati. They named the river that watered their city Sarayu- a tribute to the Harayu river in Dasavarsha to the far west, which had once been their progenitor Adiraja Ikshvaku’s chosen river of conquest. To the Suryavansha then, this Sarayu symbolised a successful conquest- their tribe’s ancient ambition had found culmination here, and Sravasti was sacred to them.

Sravasti’s line still survived along this river. In the line of his elder son, born five generations after him, Ayuddha had founded a brand-new city further downstream. Called Ayodhya, that city was the new Suryavanshi capital. And in the line of Sravasti’s younger son, also born five generations later but elder to Ayuddha, was a man called Suchandra. Suchandra was no less illustrious than his younger cousin Ayuddha, but instead of founding a new city he led a grand expansion of Sravasti itself. Under his leadership the city had cleared the forest for yojanas around, earning for Suchandra a new name- Anaranya. 

Darsana had learnt much from Anaranya, and there was much he could learn from him still. But time was short, and for now he had a specific purpose in mind. Mathu had sent him to Ayodhya, a city he could not enter as Darsana anymore. But Sravasti was open to him, and here he could find something his people truly needed. “I need access to the library, Anaranya,” he said. 

Anaranya was thoughtful. “Let me guess, you want access to the genealogies?”

Darsana frowned. “How did you know?”

“A year ago, my cousin Ayuddha himself came for them. Sometime after that a Yadava came asking for the same thing, but he refused to identify himself and we turned him away. Now you appear, another Yadava, unexpected, after many years. It was a safe guess to make.”

This confirmed to Darsana that he was on the right track. But would Anaranya allow him access? “Can I see the genealogies then?”

Anaranya assessed Darsana with sharp eyes, the wisdom of many decades shining in them. “You know, when Ayuddha asked to see them I didn’t think much of it. I had never studied them myself, and I assumed Ayuddha simply looked for Suryavanshi family trees. Before leaving, he asked me not to show them to anyone else again. That’s when I decided to study them myself. So tell me, Darsana Kavya, what is it that you’re looking for?”

He said Darsana’s name in a strange way, and Darsana wondered whether his cover was blown here as well. But he pressed on- “Puru genealogy in particular.”

Anaranya expected that. “It’s what Ayuddha too looked for. Now what does a Yadava traveller such as yourself need to know Puru genealogy for?”

Now the tone was unmistakable. Anaranya uttered the word ‘Yadava’ as if to provoke Darsana into denying it. Darsana maintained his demeanour. “You know well that I am more than a traveller, Anaranya. I explore, I study.”

“You gather, you assimilate,” Anaranya nodded. “Almost like a spy, isn’t it?”

“A Yadava spy?” Darsana said, hoping he looked incredulous enough. “You think your cousin Ayuddha’s own spies wouldn’t know this if I was? And I spent three years with you, Anaranya. I was your student.”

The hint of a wry smile still twinkled in Anaranya’s eyes, but he nodded in agreement. “True on all counts. But why Puru genealogy in particular? Why not of your own tribe? Wouldn’t you like to know the lineage of Vrishna Yadava, or Mahismata?”

Darsana tired of playing the game. “Yadava genealogy is well known to us,” he said. “But as we now form an alliance with Hastina Puru, it’s his lineage I’m more curious about.”

Anaranya expected this too. “Ah, the resurgent Puru king. Ayuddha was most curious too. You don’t need to study the genealogies for that, Darsana. I can tell you what you need to know. Hastina Puru is born in the line of Sudhanvana, who was second son of Tamsu. Tamsu in turn was born in the line of Pravira- Puru’s firstborn. Tamsu, you may remember, was the Puru king defeated by Mandhatra, my ancestor Sravasta’s twin. Tamsu was the last Puru king, and as his descendant, Hastina now claims the title.”

Darsana tried to think of how to navigate that. Anaranya had told him exactly what he’d asked for, but in reality he needed something else. How could he get that without revealing something about his true identity? Anaranya perceived the confusion on his old friend and disciple’s face. He prompted- “Would you like to know what happened to the other Puru lines after Mandhatra’s campaign?”

This was dangerously close to hinting that Anaranya already knew Darsana’s real identity, so he decided to play the game no more. “I would,” he confessed. “Specifically, about what happened to the line of Tamsu’s elder son, Ilina.”

“I thought you might, my friend. Tamsu’s elder line survived, but only barely. It is believed that Mandhatra beheaded Tamsu and Ilina himself, but was unable to bring Ilina’s infant son to death. That infant son, Dharmanetra, was smuggled to safety and took refuge at an ashrama. This ashrama belonged to another Puru line.”

“Rshi Medhatithi’s ashrama,” Darsana said, beginning to put two and two together.

“Indeed. At Medhatithi’s ashrama the young Dharmanetra grew up, and that would have been all history remembered of his line. But then he acquired a family and bore a son. Dushyanta was this young boy’s name, and he was of considerably larger ambitions than his father.”

Colour drained Darsana’s face as the full implication hit him, all thought of maintaining his cover forgotten. “I suspect you’ll have to take leave immediately now,” Anaranya suggested.

Darsana’s eyes asked the question he was too afraid to- *How do you know?*

“When you first came here, all those years ago, do you know why I took you in?”

“Why?” Darsana asked.

“I saw your sincerity. Your curiosity. You asked me questions no student has ever asked me before or since. I saw in you the possibility that all my knowledge could somehow live on. I trusted you, as I do even now.”

“You were right when you said that Ayuddha’s men know of every Yadava spy in their realm,” Anaranya continued. “But we can’t quite say the same for Bharata spies, can we? I care not for where your political alliance falls, Darsana. I care only for the promise you once made to me. Do you remember it?”

“That I will pass your knowledge on,” Darsana said. “That I will spread it to all corners of Aryavarta.”

“It’s safe to say you haven’t yet begun, isn’t it?”

Darsana nodded, feeling suitably chastened.

“Fulfill it one day,” Anaranya said. “I ask you that as a friend. Now, as a guru, even if for three years only, there is still the matter of my daksina.”

He said that in a lighter tone, and Darsana smiled. “What would you ask of me, my guru?”

“Only your real name, of course.”

Darsana told him.



**34**

“Great-grandfather is said to have battled at that very spot once,” Ketumana said, pointing to one of the several ghats visible. “Grandmother had already been born by then, and he fought more to protect his family than anything else. It’s why this place became so important to him.”

“I understand,” Vitamsi said, meaning it. It was no longer lost on her that Sunahotra’s rebellion was not really that. All he’d fought for was to retain a city, not for the title of rajan. And at this time of the year, with frequent rains powering the Ganga and turning the landscape a verdant shade of green, it was hard not to see why Sunahotra had fallen in love with Kashi. The air was pleasant throughout the day here, and at night it was cooled by currents emerging from the dense forests southwards, on the other side of the Ganga. She tried to visualise Ketumana’s childhood, a lonely boy living in a grim, broken home. A home where one person’s shadow loomed large. 

“What will you do if your grandmother refuses?” Vitamsi asked.

Ketumana took time before responding. “I love you, Vitamsi,” he said to her for the first time. “From the moment I first saw you, I have loved you. But if grandmother refuses it, I don’t know how I can go ahead with the marriage.”

Vitamsi nodded, appreciating his honesty. “Will she?”

“I don’t know,” Ketumana said, honest again.

“Well, not long before we find out,” Vitamsi commented, trying to ignore the heavy feeling in her gut.

They sat in silence for a while longer, before it started drizzling again and they had to make their way inside. A soldier approached them as they did so, rushing to them dripping wet and out of breath. “I’m looking for uparajan Samvarna,” he bowed.

“This way,” Ketumana said, leading him inside the rajanalaya. 

“Uparajan,” the soldier said the moment he saw Samvarna. “There is a man here to see you. He says his name is Darsana, but some of the older guards said he looks like-”

“Take me to him!” Samvarna said, cutting the soldier off. 

The soldier nodded and led the uparajan back into the rain, leaving Ketumana and Vitamsi exchanging curious frowns. The drizzle turned into a heavy downpour but Samvarna trudged through the mud with urgency, heart beating as hard as the raindrops pounding the ground. If the man truly was Darsana, then something monumental had happened- none of it likely to be good. The soldier led Samvarna to Kashi’s north-west wall-front, into the outpost that stood outside the city wall. 

The man inside had dried himself, but his long beard and hair still looked shaggy. It was Darsana indeed.

Samvarna pulled him into a bearhug. “It is good to see you,” he said earnestly.

“When I set out to find you,” Darsana said, “I scarcely thought I’d have to come to Kashi.”

Samvarna smiled. “Much has changed here. We will talk in private later, rajani Kashi has called a grand council tonight. Take some rest, clean yourself. Whatever has brought you here, you can tell everyone about it at the council.”

Darsana nodded, the sight of Samvarna bringing old memories back to the surface. Memories he hadn’t recalled for a long time. “It is good to see you too, brother,” he said.



**35**

The grand council of Kashi was about to commence. Rajan Tritsu Barhat of the line of Suhotra was here to plead rajani Kashi to accept his sister’s hand in marriage for Ketumana. The prospective bride and groom were willing, the larger families were willing, the line of Jahnavi was willing, only Kashi’s assent was needed. On a less rainy day the council would have been conducted in the courtyard, but now it was to be conducted in the larger inner hall where Sunahotra himself once sat. Rajani Kashi, his daughter, observed calmly as the members milled in and took their places. But her eyes widened when another man stepped in. He’d shaved his beard now and trimmed his hair, but even with them his mother would have recognised him instantly.

“Dhanu,” Kashi said weakly, unable to find her voice.

The others followed her gaze, and Tritsu saw similar waves of recognition pass across the other Kasheyas faces. It was Grtsamada’s exclamation, uttered as he bolted from his seat towards the stranger, than explained it for Tritsu and Vitamsi.

“Dhanvantari!” Grtsamada exclaimed, delight breaking upon his face as he ran to his brother and hugged him affably. Aristanemi followed soon after, and Dhanvantari then walked up to his mother- who still stared at him as if he was an apparition. He touched her feet with reverence, her hands floated to his head. No words were exchanged as she stroked his chin, tears trailing down her own. “Bless you, my boy,” she finally whispered. 

Dhanvantari then walked to his son, who stood facing him uncertainly. Ketumana had last seen him four years ago, but only as many times in his entire life. Dhanvantari too stood at an awkward distance, cupping his son’s shoulders at an arm’s length. “I am happy to see you, son,” he said. 

“You have returned at a fortuitous time, Dhanu,” Grtsamada said. “The Sauhotris are here to extend a hand of marriage for your son.”

Dhanvantari’s eyes widened curiously, but Samvarna was getting impatient. “His presence here is not a coincidence,” the uparajan said. 

“Meaning what?” Kashi said, frowning.

Seeing the confused looks on his family’s faces, Dhanvantari said- “I think it’s best I explain from the beginning, cousin.” 

“Go ahead,” Samvarna said. 

“I was twenty-one when I left Kashi,” Dhanvantari said, eyes turning to Ketumana as he said so. “My son was only a few months old, and as I left him to my mother’s care I knew not when I would return. But that very night, as I travelled through the forest, I was met by cousin Samvarna- not by accident.”

***

*“That’s it then?” Samvarna said. “You’re going to abandon your family, your son, your mother, just like that?”*

*Dhanvantari had already considered these questions before leaving. “My mind is made, brother.”*

*Samvarna gave his cousin a look of pure contempt. “Shame upon you, Dhanvantari. You know the pressure your mother is under. How is she to handle it alone?”*

*“She’s not alone. She’s got Grtsamada and Aristanemi. And now she’s got Ketumana.”*

*“A dreamer, a stoner and a baby,” Samvarna snorted. “You think they will protect Kashi?”*

*“Protect Kashi from what?” Dhanvantari snapped. “What danger do we face besides the one in Prayaga?”*

*“You’ve fathered a son, but you remain pitifully naïve, Dhanu. Have you forgotten the stories great-grandfather used to tell us? Have you forgotten that there are other tribes in Aryavarta?”*

*“Tribes we haven’t heard of for decades,” Dhanvantari countered. “And if they’re out there, well, I’ll find them, won’t I?”*

*“Find them you will,” Samvarna said assuredly. “And that’s why I’m here, cousin. Your mother may have released you from her service, but I am now uparajan of the Bharata janapada. And Kashi is a part of the janapada. Your uparajan does not release you from service.”*

*Dhanvantari chuckled. “C’mon, Samvarna. What service do you think I can perform? I am not a warrior like you.”*

*Samvarna did not see the joke. “Everyone has a role to play in the janapada- my grandmother used to say this. My role is of the warrior, and I will play it with loyalty. You clearly have a different calling in life, but that does not free you of responsibility to the tribe.”*

* Samvarna’s eyes were set dead serious in a look that, Dhanvantari knew from experience, meant he had come to a decision he would not budge from. “What would you have me do?” Dhanvantari sighed resignedly.*

*“Exactly what you intend,” Samvarna replied. “Go, travel, learn, do whatever you like. But you will also gather intelligence. You will learn what other powers are out there, who the rulers are, how strong their armies are. Who trades with whom, and what do they trade? How wealthy are they, how are their cities organised? Do they know of us and our cities, and if yes, what do they know? All this and more you will learn for your janapada, and you will report this to me from time to time.”*

*“In other words, I am to be your spy.”*

*“You can call it what you like. As I said- you are free to go wherever you like and do whatever you like.”*

*“And keep my identity secret, of course,” Dhanvantari added. “Just like a spy.”*

*“There is little wisdom in letting the world know that Dhanvantari, firstborn of Kashi, roams the lands unprotected.”*

*“I’ll be fine, Samvarna.”*

*“I’m not worried about you, but about your mother if you are held for ransom. So you will keep your identity secret, Dhanu. Not for you, but for your family.”*

*Dhanvantari chuckled despite the situation. “You really think of everything, don’t you?”*

*“It is my duty to,” Samvarna said without emotion. “Will you do your duty?”*

*“Fine,” Dhanvantari said. “I will collect the information you need and I will report it back to you, from time to time.”*

*“Good,” Samvarna nodded. “What name will you use? Use the same identity when you report to me.”*

*“Remember what great-grandfather used to call me?”*

*“Darsana.”*

*“That’s the one.”*

*“I bid you well then, cousin,” Samvarna said, clasping Darsana by the shoulder. “And I truly wish find what you’re seeking too. There’s one last thing. In your travels you might come upon a city called Ayodhya. There you will present yourself as Dhanvantari, concealing nothing about your identity.”*

*Dhanvantari frowned. “Why? Who lives there?”*

*“You’ll find out if you’re ever there,” Samvarna said. “Suffice to say that they are a people I want to know the intent of. I want to know what they do when they learn more about us. But another thing- do not tell them of the rift between Prayaga and Kashi.”*

*Dhanvantari rolled his eyes disbelievingly. “What sort of webs do you weave, cousin? You want me to tell them who I am, but not that our families are estranged?”*

*“Precisely. Let them know we are here, but not that we are weakened.”*

*“Look at you, strategising as if you’re rajan already.”*

*It was meant as a tease, but the humour went past Samvarna as usual. “Brhat will be rajan after rajan Ajamidha, not me.”*

*“You do keep saying that, but you are the eldest. So we’ll see about that, uparajan.”*

***

“Since then, I have kept Samvarna updated on what’s been happening in Aryavarta and beyond. But the last time we met, my cover was nearly blown by an unknown spy who followed me to Kampilya.”

“We killed the spy,” Samvarna said. “And I told Dhanvantari then that he was to return again only if something urgent had come up- something that had to be shared with us immediately.”

“And something has come up,” Dhanvantari said. “That’s why I am here. It is good that all three lines of Bharata are here, because this concerns all of us.” 

“Tell us then, Dhanu,” Kashi prodded.

“It’s about Bharata’s father, Dushyanta. But I need to explain this with context. A few centuries ago, the people we know as the Suryavansha began migrating from their original home- the Sindhu and Sarasvati rivers.”

“We have met crown prince Mitrasaha,” Samvarna said, seeing where the story was going. “And we’ve been to the Janaka rajan. We know of the Suryavanshi migration.”

“And of the havoc that wrought among the Pancha Gana tribes?” Dhanvantari asked.

“We learnt of that too.”

Dhanvantari was happy to not have to narrate the whole tale. “Good, then you know that the Suryavanshi migration ended the Puru line?”

“Yes.”

“Well, that’s the part where it gets grey,” Dhanvantari explained. “For one infant in the direct line of Puru survived. His name was Dharmanetra, and Dharmanetra’s son was named Dushyanta.”

Dhanvantari let that statement hang, knowing that it needed no further explanation. The elders understood the implication.  “No,” Samvarna said as it dawned on him.

But the younger Bharatas- Tritsu, Vitamsi and Ketumana, struggled to follow “What?” Tritsu urged. 

“Don’t you see it, Tritsu?” Samvarna said. “This explains everything. Dushyanta was a Puru! Born in a time after the Suryavanshi migration, the kingdom of his ancestors was lost. That was the kingdom Dushyanta reclaimed, and it was the kingdom Bharata campaigned to help establish!”

Tritsu’s mind raced, connecting the remaining dots. “And since Bharata was born to Shakuntala, who was not Dushyanta’s legitimate wife, the Purus would have rejected Bharata’s claim.”

“Exactly!” Samvarna was excitable for a change. “This is why great-grandfather did not use the Puru banner himself, establishing a janapada of his own.” Then Samvarna realised that his grandmother would have known, eyes going reflexively to his mother, Riksha.

“She never told me, son,” Riksha said, reading Samvarna’s mind. “She never told me Dushyanta was a Puru.”

“Wait, but if Dushyanta was a Puru,” Vitamsi said, catching on. “Does this mean *we *are Puru?”

Her question hung in the air, its answer keeping the elders lost in silence. It was a difficult implication to accept, but Tritsu was not done yet. “What does this mean for Hastina Puru?”

“It means we are related to him,” Dhanvantari elaborated. “Hastina is born in the line of Sudhanvana, who was Tamsu’s younger son. Dushyanta was born in Tamsu’s elder line.”

“Tamsu being the last Puru king,” Samvarna added. “It means Hastina is more closely related to us than he is to the Yadavas he’s aligned with. You know them well, don’t you, Dhanvantari?”

Dhanvantari closed his eyes, the memories bringing him pain. Samvarna was a military man, he could speak of espionage and war with emotion. But the years of secretly serving his janapada had taken their toll on Dhanvantari’s conscience. He’d betrayed Vrishna Yadava in no explicit way, having served him loyally for many years. But behind that loyalty hid ultimate treachery, for Vrishna never knew who he really was. “I know Vrishna Yadava best,” he said. “But he is old and retired. His son Mathu holds sway now, and in some measure Mathu’s uncles Vidarbha and Mahismata. It was Mahismata who attacked you in the forest, and Vidarbha you met when you took Ekachakra.”

“Does Hastina Puru know of this connection?” Tritsu asked, gears turning in his head.

“I doubt it,” Dhanvantari said. “I learnt of this from the old record of genealogies preserved in Sravasti.”

“Then we must contact him,” Tritsu said, a decisive tone to his voice. “We can put an end to this war before it begins.”

Samvarna sensed his rajan’s mind, but Kashi looked confused.
