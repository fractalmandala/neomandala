A simpler, basic version of chatGPT integrated in Sveltekit is covered [here](https://www.fractalmandala.in/web/chatgptinsveltekit).  In this guide we add more features, such as the ability to select from different bot types. The older version also shows integration with Supabase, using that as the db for all chats. In this guide we save chats to local storage on the browser. One can always further integrate it with Supabase such that chats are first kept in local storage, and select chats are transferred to Supabase when desired.
