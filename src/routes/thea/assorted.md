A makeshift stage was hastily put together, the space around it cleared for people to push against each other as they crowded inside. No one wanted to miss this, for this was the day they would tell their children and grandchildren about. Commander Tritha let himself be led to the podium by eager associates, people prostrating around him as he followed. Their voices came to him as a low drone, his head occupied by thoughts of what he was about to say. He could sense a relief in the air but did not feel it himself, his shoulders burdened by a task unfinished. The people had achieved their freedom today, and the rest of their lives would now begin. But he had one last thing to do.

“My friends,” he began, pausing to let the excited murmuring subside. “Each one of us here today is a fortunate soul. We are here today because of millions that have died for us, sacrificing their lives for the greater good of our species. Let us remember them today, even the countless whose names history never recorded. And there are heroes among us even now. We owe a collective debt to the actions of Specialist Kadorra and her team.”

The crowd erupted at that, and Tritha turned around to face Kadorra and her intrepid warriors. Less than four hours ago they had returned to the settlement, their mission a resounding success. With it, the final yoke of alien occupation was shed, and humanity could once again consider itself free after two hundred and eighteen long years. Tritha walked up to them and gave each a bear hug, whispering sincere words of gratitude in their ears while the crowd continued to cheer and applaud. When he reached Kadorra the din loudened to a zenith, and he had to shout over it when he said to her- “What you did today will go down as the single most definitive moment in human history. But it is not over, and I need you to be ready for the next wave when it comes.”

Kadorra’s eyes widened, but before she could react Tritha turned back towards the crowd. This was it- a hush descended upon the gathering as people waited for the Commander of humanity’s final resistance to deliver his historic words. Tritha sensed Kadorra tense behind him, and he would explain it better when this was all done. He glanced at his brother, and in a moment they relived shared memories of a lifetime, one with dark secrets. Turning to the crowd, Commander Vaktuki Tritha raised his voice. “Two years ago I began to really believe. I began to imagine a future where we had successfully eradicated the aliens from the planet. A future where the resistance would no longer be needed. This day does not come as a surprise to me. I have long planned for it, and I know what you expect of me now. I have led the resistance for a long time, it is natural that I’m the only leader you can think of. But a commander in war cannot be a commander in peace.”
Tritha held out his hand before a protest could break out louder. “My friends, my friends, please. Allow me to explain. Whatever I was before I joined the resistance, I am now nothing more than a man of war. Military strategies, methods to kill an alien, weapons- these are the things I know. But this is not the knowledge we now need. Now we need people who know how to govern, to resolve civil conflicts, to manage resources and build infrastructure- skills I do not possess. And this is not the only reason for us to seek a new leader.”
Tritha looked to his brother again, who stared back at him expressionless. “War is never fought in black and white, and crimes are committed by both sides.” Tritha said to the crowd. “In the years to come, it may become necessary for us to examine the crimes we committed in the years of resistance. Any such investigation should be allowed to run its full course, even if were to be directed at me. If I continue to be our leader that presents us with a serious conflict of interest, and nothing is more important than the successful establishment of a civil society.”

The crowd was silent now as it absorbed the import of Tritha’s words. The Commander had just fallen short of confessing to be a war criminal. But what kind of crimes could he have committed? Surely any crimes against the aliens did not count. Did that mean his crimes were committed against fellow humans? No, the people murmured among themselves. Commander Tritha could not have done such a thing. But if he would not lead us, who would?

“And for the same reason,” Tritha continued, “Our leader cannot be my brother either. It is time for us to make a fresh start. I invite people to come forward and nominate themselves. Think of what sort of leader we need, and whether you can be that person for us. Like the nations of old, we will hold a democratic election to select our new leader. And like the nations of old, we will balance this leader’s power by forming a cabinet of ministers, all accountable to each other. Permit this to be my last command to you all.” 

#### Chapter 1 - 50 Years Later

“Minister Kadorra,” panted Helmud as he struggled to catch up with her. “Please, the Prime Minister has requested your presence.”

Kadorra did not lessen her stride, knowing that young Helmud would not be used to the Cavern’s sharply ascending steps. “And what crisis is it this time?”

Helmud’s voice faltered as he stumbled, and Kadorra finally stopped to turn around and face him. The Cavern’s long, dizzying stairs spread out below her, descending into darkness. A lifetime ago, the Tritha brothers had liberated it after hours of battle. To people like Kadorra the Cavern was a sacred place of memory. To those born after the freedom, like Helmud, it meant little.
 
“How old are you, Helmud?”

“I am nineteen years old, minister.”

“And have been to the Cavern before this?”

“This was my first time all the way down.”

“What do you think of it?” 

“Minister, please. The Prime Minster insisted that the matter is urgent.”

“Of course he did. Lead on then, Helmud. Slow and steady.”

Helmud took a deep breath and continued, answering as he did so- “One can feel history down there, and the scarred rocks speak of the battle that took place.”

“What do you know of the battle?” Kadorra asked, not as a challenge.

“Only what is part of the standard lore. This was a deep fortress for the aliens, one that held many human captives. A contingent of seventy-two warriors led by the Tritha brothers waged battle for almost a day before liberating the captives and wiping out its alien population. Among the freed humans was a young girl who would go on to join the resistance, and eventually lead the team that won us final victory fifty years ago. Now she is known as Minister Kadorra.” 

Helmud had to stop after that to gather his breath. “Not many youngsters I know care much for the standard lore,” Kadorra commented.

“Those aren’t the youngsters working in the Prime Minister’s office, are they?”

Kadorra smiled, nodding in agreement. “No, they aren’t. Now tell me Helmud, what is it the Prime Minister has called me for?”

“I am not at liberty to say anything, minister. But he sent me for you moments after receiving word from the Ahurun City.”

Ahurun City- once the glorious capital of the continent of Ahurun. Now, it was an uninhabited urban wasteland scattered with the detritus of war. The radio beacon in Ahurun City served as a gathering point for any human survivors in Ahurun. A message from the city outpost did signal something urgent. Kadorra nodded and hastened her steps, now leading the way to the Prime Minister’s office. 

In the early years of the free era there used to be greater security around the office. Memory of alien occupation was still fresh in people’s minds, and it took time to accept that the aliens had really gone. Now Kadorra could walk right into his office, no one stopping her to check for ID. Even Helmud followed her in, which would have been impossible for an associate to do in the old days.

Prime Minister Yaktuki Tritha was waiting for Kadorra, his eyes beaming with affection as she walked in. “Minister Kadorra, thank you for coming.”

Kadorra nodded curtly. “You summoned me, Prime Minister.”

“Come now, you make it sound so authoritarian. I received a communication of urgent import, and I needed to consult my minister of defense immediately. Can it not be as innocuous as that?”

“Then get to the point.”

The affection disappeared from Yaktuki’s eyes, replaced by a cold stare that Kadorra knew was his real self. His brother, Commander Tritha, had warned her suitably before he died. 

“Ahurun City has detected an incoming signal from further east- triangulated to somewhere near Gachch.”
“Gachch was nuked.”

“I know,” said Yaktuki. “Which makes it all the more intriguing. You do remember what my brother used to say, don’t you?”

Kadorra frowned. “That the aliens would return,” she said. “Do you mean-”

“Yes, I do. The signal has not been traced to human origins. This could be them again.”

The frown stayed on Kadorra’s brow. “You were always sceptical of Commander Tritha’s second-wave theory. Now one mysterious signal makes you think this could be it? What are you not telling me?”

“Lots! As Prime Minister there is much that I keep to myself. But not in this case, Minister Kadorra. I have been sceptical of my brother’s theory, but not dogmatically so. You will recall that one of the first things I did after taking office was increase budget for the sentry program.”

That part was indeed true. The sentry program was established in the first year of the free era, under Commander Tritha’s fervent patronage. Parts of machinery and wiring were salvaged from warzones like Tratova and Ahurun City to build basic drones. These drones now circled the planet, looking for any signs of alien recurrence. Three years ago, when Yaktuki Tritha was elected Prime Minister under circumstances that Kadorra found suspicious, he immediately increased spending the sentry program. Spending that had been steadily decreasing after Commander Tritha’s death. 

“So if this is them again?” Kadorra asked.

“Then my brother will be proven true, and we can thank ourselves that we listened to him enough. Our military can be ramped up on short notice.”

“Our ramped up military will not be enough for a second-wave, if this is what it is.”

“If this is what it is,” repeated Yaktuki. “One signal isn’t proof of anything, but it certainly merits investigation.”

Kadorra chuckled, finally catching on. “So that’s what you’re not telling me, isn’t it? It’s the goo you’re looking for.”

Yaktuki Tritha did not react. “The goo helps us survive, Kadorra.”

“It helps some of us survive.”

“Including you.”

“Yes, but I don’t desire immortality. You do, Yaktuki.” She pointed to Helmud- “Does he know about the goo?”
“Nothing in this office is a secret to Helmud,” Yaktuki replied. 

“Really?” Kadorra asked, incredulous. “So he knows that repeated exposure to the goo retards human ageing? And that only a secret part of our population is aware of this or has accessed the goo?”

“As I said, nothing is a secret to Helmud.”

Kadorra turned to Helmud. “You know this, and you’re okay with it?”

“My own feelings about this do not matter,” Helmud replied.

“But what are they nevertheless?” Kadorra pressed.

“A small part of the population, the ruling class no less, living to hundreds of years while the rest live no longer than seventy or eighty. This is no sign of a free and equal society,” Helmud commented.

Kadorra turned to Yaktuki, looking for a response. “He’s completely right,” Yaktuki conceded. “We will be completely free and equal only when everyone has access to the goo.”

“You could make it so right now,” said Kadorra. 

“Except we are not ready,” Yaktuki countered. “Our institutions and laws are not ready. But they could be, in a generation or two.”

It finally dawned on Kadorra, and she turned to Helmud with comprehension. “You’re grooming him,” she said. “You want him to be the next Prime Minister.”

“I do.”

Kadorra sighed, feeling as old as her seventy one years. She no longer washed herself in goo, but during the resistance years she was exposed to enough of it to have lingering effects. She looked at least twenty years younger than she was, and like anyone exposed to goo her bones were still in excellent condition. “Do you know what was the last thing your brother said to me?” She asked Yaktuki.

“Do share.”

“Beware of my brother. He is an amoral man, and amoral men are far more dangerous than immoral men.” 
Yaktuki’s lips curved into a smirk. “My brother was always fond of words. And as always, he was completely right. Is it not a good thing that a person can be elected to this office only twice? There’s not much damage I can do, Kadorra.”

“Yes, but you can still damage enough, Yaktuki. We have known each other long enough. Once, I even looked up to you- just as much as I looked up to your brother. But anyone who ever knew you both also knew that you were twins in your looks alone. Have you already started exposing Helmud to the goo?”

Yaktuki nodded.

“How long?”

“Eight years now.”

“You’ve been exposing him to it since he was eleven years old? Where are his parents? Did they consent to this?”

“His father did. And Helmud himself was made aware of all the risks.”

Kadorra’s eyes narrowed. “Who is his father, Yaktuki?”

“He stands before you, minister. Helmud is my son.”

A dozen questions raced through Kadorra’s mind, but she pushed them back. “Then you know he can never be Prime Minister. Two members of the same family cannot take the office.”

“According to the old rules, yes,” Yaktuki conceded. “But the old rules are so quaint, don’t you think? All this idea of democratic governance and a periodic charade of voting, that’s the way our ancestors did things. But in a world of immortals, when each human as access to the goo- in that world we need a new order. Do you remember your rank in the resistance years? A Specialist, you were. In your case, the specialty was stealth sniping. Now we need specialists of a different kind. Besides, I’m not sure we need to reveal Helmud’s real lineage.” 

Kadorra nodded, gritting her teeth as she saw Yaktuki’s plan. “How well your brother knew you,” she commented. 

Yaktuki Tritha smiled, but it did not reach his eyes. “Not well enough, actually. He should have just taken office for one term- and I would never have been eligible for election myself. But he decided to be noble, to atone for past crimes- crimes you have no idea of. He would not be your hero if you knew, dear Kadorra. But we have had a lifetime to talk about Commander Vaktuki Tritha, and we will have more time still. Perhaps one day I will even tell you the complete story. But for now, Minister of Defense, you have a task to do. Will you send a team to investigate this signal, or not?”

“I will, Prime Minister,” Kadorra replied. 

“Good. But we will hope it amounts to nothing.”

“Nothing more than more goo at least,” Kadorra said sardonically.

“I would like to join the team, Minister Kadorra,” said Helmud. 

Kadorra looked to him, then back at Yaktuki, who asked- “Why?”

“I have never been out of Primia,” Helmud explained. “If I am being groomed, as you say, I need to know what’s out there.”

Kadorra scanned Yaktuki for any signs of fatherly pride, but found nothing. The Prime Minister returned to some maps on his desk. “You can go if the Minister of Defense permits it,” he said.

“You are sure, Helmud?” Kadorra asked. “You had trouble even with the Cavern’s stairs.”

“All the more reason to give my body some exercise.”

Kadorra nodded grimly. “Good, keep that spirit with you. You will need it.”

#### Chapter 2

“May I speak freely, minister?” 

“Please do, specialist Vidant,” replied Kadorra. “There need not be formality between us.”

A thorough military man, Arkan Vidant only gave a curt nod, one that indicated he would stick to formality nevertheless. “This is a military mission, minister. Associate Helmud may have standing in the cabinet, but he has no place here.” 

“I disagree, specialist Vidant. He’s spent three years in service of orbital defense. And the directive comes from the prime minister. I need not remind you that even I report to him.”

Respect for hierarchy was ingrained in Arkan, but this was an informal forum, so he pressed on- “Yet you hold veto on all critical military decisions. Have you met Helmud?”

“I have.”

“Then I would assume that you assess him capable to be a part of this mission.”

“I do, Arkan,” said Kadorra, her voice softer now. She understood Arkan’s concern well. Taking a civilian along on military missions was always an added burden. Civilians did not know how to handle themselves in the barren lands outside Primia’s secure borders. “Prime Minister Yaktuki has enough military credentials to his name. Helmud is his not only his associate but also his assigned secret service agent.” 

That seemed to put Arkan at ease. Secret service agents were picked from the cream of military institutions, including orbital defense. “Very well, minister. I trust your and the prime minister’s assessment.”

“And I thank you for that, Arkan. I assure you that the mission itself it completely under your command. How long will your team take to get ready?” 

“They are ready and waiting at the bay for further instructions.”

“Lead the way then, specialist. I’d like to see the team off.”

Arkan lead Kadorra through the underground network that lay beneath Primia, made by the aliens during their years of occupation. Walking through these tunnels, towards the main bay, always brought a wave of nostalgia to Kadorra. Fifty years ago the bay was where Vaktuki Tritha welcomed her team back and declared complete freedom from alien occupation. Arkan must have detected the long look in her eyes, for he said, “I was there among the crowds that day, when Vaktuki Tritha celebrated your team for the heroes they were.”

Kadorra’s eyes widened in surprise. Arkan looked easily around the same age as her. If he was alive then, it meant that he too had access to the alien goo. But she could not ask him that directly, for it would reveal that she knew about the goo. There was no telling how things could spiral from that revelation.

Arkan pretended to ignore the surprise on Kadorra’s face and continued- “I’ve selected six members for this mission, not counting Helmud and you. That brings our total count to 9, and I would not recommend adding more.”

“There are no more guest members,” Kadorra assured him as they took the final turn and entered Primia’s main bay. Operated by the military, it was off bounds for civilians without express authorisation from the minister of defense. Even the prime minister could not grant that authority. This was how Vaktuki Tritha had recommended the powers be split, and in the years after freedom his recommendations were almost always incorporated into the new government structures. 

The main bay was a vast underground cavern, created decades ago by the aliens for purposes that were still unknown. The consensus was that this was a place for worship for them, supported by the many carvings and hieroglyphics they etched into the cavern’s walls. Those carvings were now hidden by various military instruments and insignia, and anyone who had not seen the cavern as it was before could never guess that it was originally an alien creation. Above the surface, many of Primia’s general citizens simply assumed that the main bay was created by the military. After passing through the security apparatus, Arkan led Kadorra towards the section of the bay devoted to military administration and into the ground forces exit chambers. This was one of Primia’s three exit points to the outside world, leading out towards the desert that lay east of Primia. Arkan introduced the six members of his team.

“This is Specialist Elori Ahuri, she’s the team’s zoologist.”

“Military zoologist,” Elori corrected, “And it’s an honour to meet you, minister.”

“Military zoologist,” Arkan acknowledged, adding with a curve if his lips- “The distinction is important because regular zoologists do not battle their subjects, should the need arise.”

“Well met, Specialist,” said Kadorra. “How long have you been out?” Elori’s family name suggested she was from the continent of Ahurun, and it was not common for soldiers to be stationed outside their continent. 
“Ever since I joined the force,” Elori explained, referring to the continent Primia lay on- “Inglikan fauna is far more interesting and diverse.”

Arkan moved to his second member- “Chief Officer Amloh Primi, team guide and war veteran.”

Kadorra gave Amloh a respectful bow. “I have heard legends of your deeds in battle, Chief,” and more, for Amloh Primi had been a commander under the Tritha brothers, and one of Vaktuki Tritha’s favoured leaders. From Vaktuki Kadorra had also learnt that Amloh Primi was a man of few words, and fewer still if they were about his own past. Amloh was also one of the few soldiers who were exposed to the goo when they were young. That explained his youthful looks even at his advanced age.

“Honour, ma’am,” was all Amloh offered to that.

“Young Olenka Primi is our assistant to the chief,” said Arkan, moving Kadorra to the third member. 

“And what was your specialisation, assistant?” Kadorra asked.

“Sniping, ma’am,” Olenka replied proudly. “Just like you.”

Kadorra smiled. The number of female soldiers that enlisted into sniping had risen sharply after the success of Kadorra’s team. Olenka’s young age implied that she was of the generation that was most inspired by legends of the young Kadorra, a female sniper who had killed more aliens than any known human in history. 
“Trainee Mayok Primi reports to me,” said Arkan introducing the fourth member. “She intends to specialise in long range bombardment.” 

“An honour to finally meet you ma’am,” said Mayok, shaking Kadorra’s hand. 

“Officers Othrank Ingla and Pritha Riyuk have been with me since I first began leading teams,” said Arkan, introducing the final two members of his selected team. Othrank and Pritha looked every bit the veterans that Amloh was, but younger. Kadorra realised that these were Arkan’s war brothers- part of the team that raided across the continent of Trithana to cleanse it of any alien survivors, giving Arkan his initial fame. 

“It is an honour to meet all of you,” said Kadorra. “I rate Commander Arkan Vidant very highly. And if he has chosen you then I understand that each of you are capable, proven soldiers. This may be a routine mission for all we know, but it may also be something else. I need you to be prepared for that something else.” 
She turned to Arkan and asked- “Do they know about our civilian guest?”

“They do. We are ready to leave as soon as he joins us.” 

#### Chapter 3

“As always, you should know that there is nothing I hide from you,” Yaktuki Tritha said into his phone. 

“As always, you know that I trust you anyway, my lord.”

“Will you ever stop calling me that? We live in a different time now, you know.”

“I don’t, my lord.”

Yaktuki Tritha chuckled, a rare moment where he was genuinely moved. “What have  I done to deserve this loyalty from you?” 

“I have been loyal to you since your birth.”

“You cradled me in your arms, I know,” said Yaktuki. “But why not my brother?”

It was the voice’s turn to chuckle. “You’re feeling philosophical today,” he commented. 

“Perhaps. I’m wondering what all of this will lead to.”

“Completion of the mission,” the voice replied matter-of-factly.

“Yes, that. But a lot depends on you now.”

“You can count on me, my lord.”

“And I hope He will not be a problem?” 

“He will not.”

“I wish you well then, my friend,” said Yaktuki, his voice earnest. “History might well judge me a villain. But your loyalty gives me much comfort.”

“There’s one thing your brother often said, and I quite agree with.”

“Which is?”

“History is not what actually happened. It’s what the winner decides to record.”

Yaktuki Tritha laughed aloud at that, reminded of one of the things he actually liked about his elder twin- his unfiltered candour. “He may have been right about that,” he acknowledged. 

“He was,” insisted the voice. “And you know that, my lord. You would not have become prime minister now if you did not.”

“That’s true enough,” Yaktuki accepted. “It may be a while now before we talk again. You know Kadorra. And you know who trained her.”

“I’m aware, and I’m prepared.”

“Good. And I trust the brief on Arkan Vidant does not change your resolve?”

“It does not.”

“Fare well then, my friend. Remember the mission.”

“It’s all I do,” said the voice, the only one in the world that Yaktuki Tritha trusted. As he hung up, he found himself missing his brother for once. For all their differences, they had always been able to confide in each other. Yaktuki missed that presence, but he did not for a moment allow himself to regret its absence. 
***

“You’ve seen your maps, the desert ends when we curve north,” briefed Amloh. “We trek north till a few hundred kilometres south of Deoranya. There we take the sea.”

“Forgive me for asking what may be obvious to everyone else,” said Helmud, “But why did we not take the sea from Primia itself?” 

An impatient looked crossed Amloh’s eyes, and Arkan stepped in- “We’re trying to travel secretly, young man. This also explains why we’re not taking the sea from Deoranya’s port.”

Helmud nodded as if that only confirmed something he already knew. He kept mostly to himself, sensing the group’s discomfort with a civilian guest on this journey. He did not mind that one bit, for it allowed him to takes his notes without disturbance. Vegetation was sparse in this part of Inglika, the land barren save a few bushes stubbornly clinging to life even after centuries of alien toxification. Rodents and insect of all sizes were spotted often, but larger mammals would appear only as they crossed Inglika’s central mountain range into the north- towards Deoranya. The only disappointment Helmud felt was that they would not actually make it to Deoranya, but take sail a little south of it. More than a thousand years ago, Helmud’s ancient ancestors had first sailed to Deoranya from the continent named after them- Trithana. At Deoranya, Deo Tritha had established the capital of his new empire. In the traditional genealogy that had been taught to Helmud, there were 35 Tritha rulers between Deo Tritha and Helmud’s father and uncle- the twins Yaktuki and Vaktuki. 
“Time to go, civvie,” shouted Trainee Mayok Primi, nineteen years of age like Helmud, and youngest military member of the team. 

Helmud gave her a smirk. “You’re clearly happy not being the lowest rank here, trainee Primi,” he commented. 
“Too many Primis in this group,” she replied, ignoring his jibe. “Call me Mayok.”

“Only if you call me Helmud.”

Mayok laughed good naturedly. “No way that’s happening, civvie!”

Helmud liked her amiable nature, but he still preferred to be left alone. He had nothing in common with these people, and but for his brief stint in orbital defense he had nothing in common with the military way. He hung back, waiting for her to leave, before picking up his bag pack and trailing behind the group. This was his first time exploring the planet his ancestors once ruled. He wanted to soak as much of it as he possibly could. 

At the group’s head, Chief Officer Amloh Primi walked alongside Commander Arkan Vidant, conversing about something Amloh preferred not to discuss. 

“When was the last time you two saw each other?” asked Arkan.

“I care not to remember,” Amloh replied. “And he’s a Commander like you now.”

Arkan understood the implication of that and nodded. It was always strange for young military recruits to see someone as experienced and able at Amloh still serving at the rank of chief officer, and stranger still for those recruits to eventually outrank him and become commanders. It was only later in his career that Arkan learnt the reason for this. Most of the veterans who served under the Tritha brothers still desired to serve alone, not lead. They preferred the engagement of infantry, not the stratagem of leadership. All of them but one, and Arkan sensed that Amloh did not want to talk about him. 

“Forgive me for asking this, Amloh. But your relationship with him will not be a problem, will it?”
Amloh’s face was expressionless as he replied, “He is a Commander and I am a Chief Officer. Insubordination is not in me, Commander Vidant.”

“That has never been in doubt, Chief Officer Primi. But you share a relationship that transcends all this.”
This time Amloh turned to look Arkan square in the eyes. “Nothing transcends military duties, young Commander. Or have you forgotten I taught you that?” Not waiting for a reply, Amloh turned back ahead and quickened his pace. 

***

“This your first time out of Primia, eh civvie?” 

“Indeed it is, Primi,” Helmud replied, unamused. Despite his reticence, Mayok engaged him at every opportunity. 

“You keep doing that,” said Mayok. “Only a matter of time before Chief Officer Amloh thinks you’re talking to him and writes you up for insubordination.”

“Yes, because at his age he’s surely not used to being surrounded by fellow Primis,” commented Helmud, not trying to hide his sarcasm. “What’s with the name anyway? The people of Primia are really short on imagination, are they?”

“Well where are you from then?” Mayok challenged with humour, bumping her shoulder into Helmud’s. “And what’s your family name for that matter?” 

“I am Helmud Hana from Tratova,” lied Helmud. 

“Hana?” Mayok repeated. “What sort of name is that?”

“A common name in Trithana,” replied Kadorra, slowing her pace to walk with the two. “I stopped using it years ago, but it was my family name as well.”

“With respect, I knew that, minister,” said Mayok. “I’m just having fun ribbing the civvie. He’s awfully unfriendly though.”

Kadorra smiled, realising that for Mayok and Helmud both it was rare to engage with people of their age. “Associate Helmud’s political life allows him little space for humour, Trainee Mayok. You must be patient with him.”

Mayok gestured to the endless land all around him. “And where’s he going to run to anyway!”

Even Helmud had to chuckle at Mayok’s unabashed demeanour. “I’m not the military person you are, Primi,” he said. “It’ll take you seconds to run me down.”

“As long as you know that,” Mayok said with satisfaction. 

Amloh’s voice broke out from ahead, informing the group that they would set camp here for the night. Twelve nights into the fifty day trek towards Deoranya, Helmud smiled as he lay his bag down. There was no feeling better than laying down under the night sky outside of Primia. Out here, without any city lights to cloud one’s vision, the glory of space was visible for open wonder. Once again Mayok chuckled and shook her head as she set her tent, and once again Helmud shrugged as he opted to sleep without one. But he was surprised when Chief Officer Amloh walked up to him and said- “Mind if I set my bed beside you tonight, Associate Hana?”
 Momentarily unsettled, Helmud watched as Amloh set his bed beside him nevertheless, his air of cold nonchalance not unlike what Helmud had often seen in his father. “Feel free to, Chief,” said Helmud drily, gathering himself after Amloh had settled in. 

“You don’t look like him, you know,” said Amloh. When Helmud returned a blank stare he continued- “Your father, the Prime Minister.”

Now genuinely shocked, Helmud did not know what to say.

“Of course, even if people knew Yaktuki Tritha to be your father, the looks could easily be misattributed to your mother,” continued Amloh, ignoring the obviously tongue-tied look on Helmud’s face. “But that’s because most people have never seen Vaktuki Tritha, the elder twin.”

“For a notoriously tacit man, you seem to have quite to say, Chief Officer Amloh,” said Helmud, remembering his training and trying to take control of the situation. 

“Standard offensive diversion,” said Amloh approvingly. “That’s good to see in a son of Yaktuki Tritha.” 
“And you know this because I look like my dead uncle,” offered Helmud.

“More accurately, you carry the look of your dead grandfather, one that previously manifested in his elder son. The Tritha twins were not identical, after all. But unlike most people, you probably know this already, son of Yaktuki.”

“So you knew my grandfather as well?” asked Helmud, determined to keep this conversation under his check. 
“One of the only two people alive who did. I was recruited under the rulership of King Sarvadeo Tritha, and I was there when your father and uncle were born.”

“That’s something I did not know,” confessed Helmud. “Of all the things my father has taught me, his own past is not one of them. But if it’s my resemblance to Vaktuki Tritha that gave me away, then very few people alive are likely to guess my lineage. So tell me, Amloh Primi, why do you discuss this with me in privacy? Am I to understand you wish to strike a bargain?” 

The glitter of countless stars shone down upon the barren desert, and in the reflected light from two of Thea’s three moons Helmud could see Amloh’s widened smile. “And what would you offer to me in return for my silence, young Tritha? No, rest easy. I reveal my knowledge to you only to warn you that others may realise your lineage as well. Especially Commander Triarka Ahuri.” 

“Commander of Ahurun’s entire military force, along with you the Tritha twins second-in-command during war years, and I could guess now- the only other living person who has met late king Sarvadeo Tritha?” 
“You humour me now, young Tritha. Surely your father has told you more about Triarka Ahuri.” 
“As I said, Chief Officer, my father does not offer much about his past.” 

Amloh’s eyebrows furrowed in the darkness. “Triarka Ahuri was your grandfather’s childhood friend and companion. And tutor to your father, uncle and me.”

There was much that Amloh had to know, and much that he assume Helmud to know, for him to make that declaration. It meant not only that Amloh knew about the goo, but also that he knew about Triarka Ahuri’s decades’ long access to it. He apparently had no hesitation revealing this to Helmud, nor in assuming that Helmud knew enough about the goo to understand. 

“Do others in this team know about this stuff, Chief?”

“Good,” commended Amloh. “Assess the landscape, identify the variables. This is your father’s teaching in you, which is in turn Triarka’s teaching in him. I know all this because I am of the old world, young Tritha. Of a time when a king still walked upon Thea. I have closely served that king, and then his sons.” 

“Though your loyalty was to the eldest,” noted Helmud, keeping accusation out of his tone.
“Loyalty is always to the first-born, boy or girl. That has been our way.”

“I do not challenge it,” accepted Helmud, realising now that Amloh could be his window to Thean history that his father rarely provided, and never in full. 

Amloh’s voice brought him back to the present- “What does the prime minister think this signal really is?” 
“He isn’t sure,” Helmud replied honestly. “But Commander Ahuri is certain the signal is alien. But even he did not comment beyond that.” 

“It is unlike Triarka to await a team from Primia when he can march out from Ahurun City himself,” Amloh commented.
