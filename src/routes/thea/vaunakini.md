The Vaunakini is a mystical, esoteric text that was discovered in the early 2100s in southern Yaktuki.  It is apparently written by a Vaunaki named Triarka, once a soldier in the Trithas’ army.  There is little or no archeological and anthropological evidence to support the text but in the recent few decades it has become quite popular among the Thean populace.  

The text uses a poetic and allegorical style to tell the story of the Trithas’ journey across Thea.  Also, it portrays them as half-human half-alien super beings and attributes to them various powers and abilities.  Much of the discovered text was torn and a lot more of it is written in a style so obtuse that it is extremely difficult to comprehend and draw rational inferences from.  Yet the Vaunaki cult in Thea is growing strong on half worship, half awe of the mythical beings like Vaunaki and Vedantin mentioned in the text.  Here are some of the comprehensively interpreted excerpts from the text:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">On the Vaunaki:</span>

“...and when the losses were great, when too many of his men were lost to death, Vaktuki Tritha looked upon his twin and said, ‘we must raise the Vaunaki.’”

“...so new and harsh was the very name to this world that the mountains trembled and the river Igmand itself veered away from the armies of the Twins.  Vau, the Eternal God of Death and Destruction; and Naki, soldiers bred to fight and kill.  Vau himself sent the Vaunaki to the Twins, for they were his sons too.”

“...darkness scorched the black land when the first Vaunaki set foot on Thea.  Great cloud masses gathered at the Igmand plains to herald the arrival.  As more soldiers set foot misery poured forth across the black land, and the savage tribes were pierced with visions of their horrid end.”

“...the tribes were no match.  We Vaunaki hurled at them our flames and our bolts cleansed the mountains of their filth.”

“...Yaktuki’s rage drove us fiery.  We sliced and butchered every last savage, every last child of this land that had taken the beloved Vaktuki from us.”

“...and when Yaktuki took the Peaks of Tritha to his adopted land, we refused.  Servants of Vau, we were forever bound to his eldest.  In the Trithas that was Vaktuki, and for Yaktuki we only had ever loyal love.  We stayed where Vaktuki really came from, and that is where we wait for when we are needed.”

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">On the Vedantin:</span>

“...for maybe they loved us not, and feared being near us.  The Twins sent us Vedantin generals, and even the Vaunaki shuddered at that.”

“...but no land was scorched where they set foot.  No dark clouds gathered to bid them a morbid welcome.  They walked soft and saw through things.  Some had wings and led the battles from the skies, like great king birds of the ancients lands.  Some crawled under the land, silently sucking in hapless savages to their end.”

“...and the Vedantin king- Pritha- called upon his brother Vau, ‘guide me’ he prayed.”

“...’you go where my Son goes’ was our Master’s command.”

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">On the Trithas:</span>

“...the pact was struck, and Vidanta conceded defeat to his Brothers.  Vau blessed the waters of river Ariguna with his seed and forever became Kadorra the Holy Land.  Born to its power were the two parts of the Sun- Vaktuki and Yaktuki Tritha.”

“...Tritha, for that was their mortal lineage.  Tuki, for they were lesser prakas to the higher Prakas like Vau and Vidanta.  Vak the elder held first sway over the prakic force that flew through the umbilical to the Twins.  Yak the younger closed the lid and bound the force within the Twins’ being.”

“In Vaktuki resided Vau, his father.  Our devotion to him was complete, our kadoras were ever destined to be Vaunaki but on Thea we were the Vaktukinaki.”

“Fierce and consummate was their battle.  Two beings one in mind.  Vaktuki would spray the enemies with fatal arrows, faster than even the Vaunaki eye could see.  Yaktuki deep in trance, giving them their protective shield.  The ones that got closer were burnt by sheer energy.”

“Yaktuki need not have raged.  For losing our beloved Vaktuki we would have burnt the lands to ash and sent it into the darkness of the black skies.  So deep was our grief that the Vaunaki lost purpose.  When the black land was sent to death we had nowhere to go.  Vaktuki was lost to us and Yaktuki cared not for the Vaunaki.  With Vaktuki died the Vaktukinaki.”

“...Vau forgot us long ago, the Brothers care not for they have their own Nakis.  No living Tritha deserves the name and the Vedantin generals are wasted.  But the Vaunaki wait...”

“...but the Vaunaki did wonder.  Who were these tribes that had troubled the Trithas’ sons of Vau?  And in the ancient Vaunaki heart did an excitement glimmer.  Ages it had been since we met worthy rivals.  Vau had forgetten but Vaktuki his son remembered us.”

“...and even in the olden lands was a giggle heard, for a Vedantin to be a farmer?”

“...we heard of the Elanaki, and how they conquered seven worlds for their master Ela- the Eternal God of Life and Being.  We heard of the Othranaki, and how their master Othra- the Eternal God of Creation and Thought sent them to new worlds every day.  And yet Vau cared not.  And then the ghostly whispers that come from across the black skies told us- the Eternal God of Death and Destruction had stopped all destruction. “
