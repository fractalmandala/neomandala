As a child, Lek had heard from all elders the horrific tales of Prakan atrocity.  Caught unawares by a vicious and war-mongering cousin species, the Antas as a species and as a civilization had forever ended after that betrayal.  The young Lek, prone to wandering in the gigantic generation ship that was his home, picked up numerous stories from fellow ship mates.  In particular, he was always moved by the stories of what the surviving Antas did to protect themselves.  Fleeing in generation ships to lost corners of space, they modified their entire genetic code to remove anything that marked them as Antan.  It wasn’t without its prices.  The ‘evolved’ Antas, if they could be called that, forever lost the species’ bank of knowledge that was stored in its genes, the bank that linked it genetically to an even ancient species that also spawned the Prakas.  They regressed on their technologies, destroying and reconstructing their ships in empty space to resemble nothing that left an Antan trace.  They changed their names to Vedantin, to mean ‘what’s left of the Antas’ in their new language.  And then they took an oath- that they shall avenge the betrayal.  

More than two thousand years ago, Vedantins had visited Thea to make the first investigations.  That was in secret- that was when they were still afraid to draw Prakan attention, when they were too weak to defend themselves.  Things were different now, they feared the Prakas no more, and hungered for open battle.  Lek was a proud Vedantin flier, a senior ranked one at that.  He stood in the observation deck of the 'Prithatuk', one of the most powerful Vedantin warships.  The 'Prithatuk 'had served as a generation ship to the original fleeing Antas, later being reconstructed as the best Vedantin warship of its time.  Even today, its battle capacity was formidable, the test runs had proven that.  Seated on the chair in front of Lek was Pritha- Commander of the 'Prithatuk', Clan Head to the Prartha strain of the Vedantin, original Anta-turned-Vedantin, a Tha- Second among the Vedantins to the Eternals, and brother to Eternal Vau.  To Lek, Pritha was God.

“Lek,” began Pritha, “there has been a certain change in our plans.  We expected to reach Thea undetected.”

“Yes, Father Tha.”

“That, however, is not so.  A Prakan warship hails us.”

It was not known among the Vedantin for a flier to show his emotions to a Tha.  There was only an exchange of orders and executions.  

“How did it pass our stealth systems, Father?”

“Our best technology may be no match for the war monsters the Prakas may have developed by now.  Our enemy, Lek, is unknown.”

“Orders, Father Tha.”

“We are to stand and fight, and if possible prevent this ship from sending any communication waves.  This is what my ship has been built for.  Let us unleash it upon them.”

“Yes, Father Tha.  I will prepare my men.”

Pritha nodded.  “You may leave.”

Lek bowed and left, his heart racing.  Born of the new generation of Vedantins, Lek inherited the same impatience and aggression towards the Prakas his contemporaries did, pitting him against the patient and waiting philosophy of the older generations.  Fortunately for him, his Commander was an elder Vedantin who endorsed the aggressive stance.  Pritha’s attitude towards war and the Prakas was responsible for the 'Prithatuk 'being the best warship the Vedantins could muster.  And it was Lek’s determination that made his flier battalion the best in the entire Vedantin fleet.  Thousands of years ago the Vedantins had marked Thea as the decisive battleground, for it was where the Prakas had unleashed their betrayal.  Since taking the oath of revenge, the Vedantin counted time in Thean years.  By Lek’s count it was now eight hundred years that he and his battalion had been training for battle against the Prakas.  For the last two hundred they had been surveying the humans on Thea, gauging their battle capacities and preparing counter measures.  

In his head he played out the tactic they had practiced countless times.  His fliers would target the enemy warship’s flying units, drawing them away from the two warships.  Two small squadron would stay hidden within the 'Prithatuk', to be revealed at the opportune moment.  When the enemy fliers are drawn away, the 'Prithatuk 'would unveil its bombarding arsenal, raining a hail of hull crushing explosives too fast for the enemy ship to manoeuvre out of.  Lek’s fliers would continue to battle the enemy fliers away from the ships.  Amid this bombardment the 'Prithatuk 'would release two virus drones, designed to disable enemy communication and transport systems.  Momentarily it would drop its shields, to further draw enemy attention away from the drones.  Seeing its shields dropped, the enemy ship would move for the kill- unveiling its deathly missiles.  One of the secret squadron would then fly out and destroy the missile launchers so exposed.  Undoubtedly, the enemy ship would have a backup squadron of its own, and the second secret squadron would assist the first in dealing with that.  Once the enemy ship’s communication is down the 'Prithatuk 'could send a virus to do nearly anything, including making the ship self destruct.  The bulk of Lek’s fliers would lead enemy fliers away from the ships, but Lek would himself lead the first secret squadron.  To Lek the plan was simple and foolproof.  He knew the 'Prithatuk’s 'shield would hold and they could jump away if it came to that. But a lot depended on destroying the enemy ship’s missile launchers, and he wanted to make sure it was done right.

At the observation deck Pritha stood proud and confident, observing the Prakan warship coming closer on his radar.  The fliers were ready, as were his virus drones Cket and Ardo.  He would personally unleash the 'Prithatuk’s ' weapons on them, and he would take much pleasure out of doing so.
