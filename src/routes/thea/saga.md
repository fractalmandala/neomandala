Most people dislike being woken up in the middle of the night, Ananuk Vikratik was one of them.  But being the Head of the Kadorran Science Agency (KSA) was a full time job in the real sense, and so bleary eyed and quite irritated at the caller, he dragged himself out of bed.

His office-cum-bedroom was located on the top floor of the west wing.  From the window, Ananuk had a view of the entire Kadorran skyline.  Kadorra never slept, and even at this hour, he could see the illuminated levitators and flashes of aerials whizzing by.  Making his way to the polymachine, he accepted the incoming call.

“Ananuk Vikratik, who’s on the line?”

“Ananuk Vikratik the Head of KSA?”

“The very same.”

“I am sorry to call you so late into the night, Sir Vikratik, but I am calling from Yaktuki, you see; and it’s not quite evening here.”

“That’s understandable; sir?”

“Faolvay Yuan.”

“THE Faolvay Yuan?  Admiyogi of Yaktuki?”

“The very same, sir.”

“This is quite an honor, Sir Faolvay.  How may I be of service to you?”

“On the contrary, it is I who can be of service to you, Sir Ananuk.”

Ananuk’s bleariness was fast vanishing.  It was not always that the Admiyogi of Yaktuki called on you, but when he did, you could be sure it was something very important.

“How so, Sir Faolvay?”

“Please, call me Faolvay, and what I have to share with you cannot be told through the wire.  I am inviting you to Yaktuki, in my official capacity.”

Quickly, Ananuk pulled out a note screen and put one hand, ready, on the keypad.  

“When would you want me there, Faolvay?”

“As soon as possible.”

“I can leave in an hour.”

“Then counting the time it will take you to reach here, we shall be expecting you in three hours.”

“I’ll be there,” Ananuk replied, and hung up.

He typed a swift message for the deputy Head, explaining his sudden departure; then called up his personal pilot.  After delivering the proper instructions, he packed a few belongings, his polymachine, and the multi-cleanser into a bag.  Within twenty minutes, he was in the air.

Inside the steady hum of his aerial, he could barely hear the sound of the city outside; but if its skyline was impressive from his office, the vista was breathtaking when viewed from the air.  Kadorra was accepted on all of Thea as the most beautiful region of all, and on flights like this, Ananuk knew why.  Directly below him lay the Holy Lake, believed to have been formed from the tears of the deity Drah-mi himself.  He could see the light of his own aerial reflected as a tiny pinprick on the Lake surface.  Beyond the Lake, to the north, were the terraganglions, weaving through the forest to make a dizzying view.  It was towards the southern borders of the forest that Kadorra proper ended.  He could make out, as his aerial rose higher, and towards the forest, the elaborate structures that he knew were built by the KSA to study and observe, at close range, the various species that resided in the woods.  

He turned left in his seat, and his eyes followed the transport tunnels further south to where the Residential Sectors began, and that’s where the levitators were visible.  Tall, imposing, and suspended many feet above the surface, the levitators were home to almost eighty percent of the Kadorran population.  He too had lived there when he was younger, and it was only after becoming Head of the KSA that he had moved out.  He could make out the densely packed transport tunnels, aerials moving in them at high speeds.  Quite a few of them were roaming in the free air, and their drivers, Ananuk knew, were in no hurry of time.  The tunnels led further south, winding through the Administrative Sector, circling the Industrial and Commercial Sectors, leading back to the Lake, at whose southern tip laid the KSA.  

In this way the transport tunnels defined the southern boundary of Kadorra proper.  Further south of them were the Kadorran mountains, but there were not visible from his aerial.  His eyes feeling a little tired, Ananuk reclined on his seat and closed them.  But he could imagine the aerial flying over the forests now, and climbing higher still to avoid the Thean Gir Mountain Range that would appear in a few minutes.  He recalled that it was on these mountains that the people of Kadorra had first encountered the Yaktukans.

His pilot broke into his thoughts, “mild atmospheric turbulence has been detected, Sir.  You better put on you safety shield.”

Ananuk opened a panel on a pod to his left and pulled out a thin metallic sheet.  Carefully opening it, he spread the on the surface in front of him.  It was covered with numerous touch sensitive pads, each to fulfill a different function.  He pressed one of them, and an invisible but perceptible envelope covered him entirely.  Deciding to use the time to read up some information on Yaktuki and its Admiyogis, he pulled out his polymachine from his bag and placed facing him.  Accessing the KSA database, he ran a quick search for Yaktuki.  On the left panel of the viewing screen he could view:

No surprises there, 'Ananuk thought to himself as he closed the lid of his polymachine.  The Yaktukans were notorious for being highly secretive and more than any region it was Yaktuki that was called on by the Emperor to prove its allegiance.  It was typical of them that they had broken into his search and withheld some data from reaching him.  Technically, this wasn’t allowed; under the Emperor’s commands no region was to withhold any information from the other, but regions often did, and it was an unspoken agreement that none would take another up to the Emperor’s Court.  

Looking out below, he could see the Gir Mountain Range drawing to a close.  On its northern borders here, the mountains gradually fell in height, merging seamlessly and elegantly with the Yaktukan plains.  As his pilot began to lower the aerial, individual structures appeared discernible.  Ananuk spotted the bizarre Yaktukan architecture at once, with its erratically twisted edifices and angular domes.  All of them were varying shades of grey and black, and stood in a stark contrast to the pale yellow fields.  He guessed that there were farms, as farming was perhaps the only physical activity the Yaktukans indulged in, the remainder of their time spent in mental exercises and endeavours.  

“We will arrive at the landing strip in less than ten minutes, sir.”  His pilot informed him through the headpiece.

He opened his polymachine again, and sent a quick return call to Faolvay, informing him of his arrival.  He then accessed the Yaktukan maps from his database, and saw that the Yaktukan Research Center was not too far away from Yaktuki Air Fields.  When he exited his aerial however, he was greeted with the sight of a Yaktukan awaiting him, flanked by Yaktukans on either side.

The Yaktukan in the middle was tall and skinny.  His cheeks were hollow and had a protruded chin.  Ananuk could see he had the stereotypical Yaktukan nose and ears: sharp and pointed.  But his eyes were deep and bright, almost curious.  The Yaktukan broke into a welcoming smile as Ananuk approached him, extending his left arm in greeting.

“Welcome, Sir Ananuk, we appreciate your joining us on such a short notice.  I am Admiyogi Faolvay.”  He stated the latter part with a simple bow.

Ananuk was caught off-balance by the Admiyogi receiving him personally, and he struggled to find his words.

“I-its-I am honored, Sir Faolvay.  I wasn’t expecting you to personally come welcome me.”

“You are a guest on official invitation, Sir Ananuk, and I must request you to call me merely Faolvay.”  He led Ananuk away from the aerial to a surface transporter.  “If you will take a seat in this transporter, it will lead you to my office, where we can discuss the business that brings you here.”

“Aren’t you joining me in it?”

Faolvay smiled lightly, “I am bound by the Trithan Command, Sir Ananuk, and much as I wish, I must not share transport with a non-Yaktukan.  My apologies for this anachronous practice.”

Faolvay waited while Ananuk seated himself in the transport, then departed with another bow for his own transport which was parked next to Ananuk’s.  Looking around, Ananuk figured that the transport was automated, and there was no human manning it.  This did not discomfort him too much, and he tried to enjoy the Yaktukan scenery on the way.

Yaktuki did not possess the transport tunnels of Kadorra, nor did Ananuk sight too many aerials.  This, he knew, was not because the Yaktukans were ignorant of such technologies, but because they tried to use as little of it as possible.  Faolvay’s words echoed in his mind- 'I am bound by the Trithan Command, Sir Ananuk-.  'Ananuk knew about the Trithan Command; it was a code of ethics and behaviour laid down for Yaktukan society and individuals by their founding father, Tritha Yaktuki.  The Command emphasized minimalism as the way of life, but a large part of it also dealt with elaborate rituals that elucidated, among other things, the proper way to interact with non-Yaktukans.  

The ground transport was not much fast either, and it glided along the ground at a comfortable pace, giving Ananuk ample opportunity to take in the Yaktukan landscape.  He was struck by the fact that despite their relative austerity, the Yaktukans designed structures that were at best, bizarre, and at worse, macabre.  He watched numerous constructions, in varying forms of awry projections go by as the transport slithered through the pathways.  Before long, however, the transport made its way into a tunnel, which led to the Yaktukan Research Center.  When it halted, Ananuk saw the entire interior panel to his left rise up and leave a comfortable opening for him to exit.  

Admiyogi Faolvay was already waiting for him, this time flanked by Yaktukans Ananuk knew through contact to be the Research Center’s scientists.  One of them was Rabik Humek, who had interacted with Ananuk on numerous previous projects.  Rabik was the opposite of Faolvay in terms of physical structure.  He was short and plump with a dense, pure white beard that fell all the way to his round belly.  Like Faolvay though, his eyes too were deep and bright; Ananuk wondered if that was a common Yaktukan trait.

“Ananuk, my old friend,” Rabik delightedly exclaimed the moment he saw him, “it is a pleasure to see you again!”

Ananuk found himself grinning in return, “and it’s a pleasure to see you too, Rabik!” 

Faolvay and the others waited politely while Ananuk and Rabik exchanged a few more pleasantries.  Then Faolvay gestured for him to follow and he was led through various corridors to a large room with just enough seats to seat them all.  Ananuk noticed that two Yaktukans always flanked Faolvay, and as the latter sat, these Yaktukans remained standing by his either side.  Ananuk himself took the seat directly in front of Faolvay, and Rabik sat next to him.  

When everyone was seated, all eyes (including Ananuk’s) turned to Faolvay.  “It is important that we first introduce our guest, Sir Ananuk, to the matter of discussion.”  Ananuk waited for Faolvay to continue, “tell me, Sir Ananuk, why is that we have been unable to colonize other planets so far?”

Ananuk very much desired that Faolvay stop calling him ‘sir’, but he was unsure of how to bring that up, since Faolvay had done it in his turn.  “Our technology restricts us, Faolvay; that and the nature of our star system.”

“By that you mean to say that there are no planets in this star system that are habitable.”

Ananuk nodded.

“And we do not have the technology to propel us beyond?”

Ananuk nodded again.

“And that is what we have called you here for, Sir Ananuk.  We have discovered the tool that will help us reach beyond the lonely confines of our star system.”

“I do not know what to make of this, Rabik.”  Ananuk admitted.  He was seated in Rabik’s personal residence; the morning’s meeting with Faolvay and Yaktukan scientists playing on his mind.

“What’s there to make, friend Ananuk?  Agreed that the technology is weird and abnormal, but it works, and that is all we need.”

“How do you know it works when you haven’t tested it yet, Rabik?”

“Because it is Yaktukan, my friend; the theoretical testing it has been subjected to by the best of us is more than adequate to ensure its validity.”

Ananuk chuckled in spite of himself, “you Yaktukans are notoriously haughty, Rabik; do you know that?”

“Yes I do;” replied Rabik, with a mischievous grin on his face, “but you Kadorrans are notoriously holy, and do YOU know that?”

Ananuk snickered knowingly, and nodded.  “But on a serious note, Rabik, I want you to explain it to me again, without the Yaktukan terminology.” 

Rabik chortled, “I will try, Ananuk.  For your ease, picture the targetspheres game.  Your point is fixed on the surface, and you cannot move your striker.  But you can direct the targetsphere to any of the seven holes.  Picture the targetsphere as the chunk of matter we would want to move, and the seven holes as seven colonize-able planets.  The surface borders are analogous to the plane of the reflective universe.”

“An apt analogy, my friend; I begin to see the picture now.  In targetsphere we shoot the sphere at the required angles according to which hole we target; similarly, to direct a chunk of matter across space to a particular point, we must shoot it at the reflective universe at the necessitated angle.”

Rabik nodded encouragingly, “you see the picture now, friend.  Our discovery of this ‘Reflectiverse’, so to speak, combined with the technology we have devised to direct matter onto its plane, is the key to inter-stellar travel.”

But Ananuk shook his head in the negative, “while I admit this is a groundbreaking discovery, Rabik, there are many questions that need to be addressed first.”

“Like?”

“Like what will be the side-effects of such matter field disturbances?  What will be the time lapse involved?  How will we get the matter to return?”

“All questions can be answered with time, my friend.  The side-effects of this we can only study once the process begins full scale.  To return the matter we must of course build a Reflecting Conductor on the other side of the journey as well, and I allow that we will need much planning and work on this aspect.  As for the time lapse, there will be none.”

“How does that work?”

“Because in theory, the matter will not be traveling any distance at all.  Take the analogy of the targetsphere again.  There is a time difference between the moment you strike the sphere and the moment it enters the hole because there is some distance between the sphere and surface borders, as well as hole and surface borders.  But in this case, there is NO distance between the Reflectiverse and our own universe, simply because the former does not lie with the space of the latter.  So the matter will hit the Reflectiverse at the exact moment of activation and re-appear on the target planet at precisely the same moment it disappears from the point of origin.”

“Rabik, it is hard for me to accept all this without a single test run or at least some form of empirical backing.”

“It is backed by Yaktukan theory, Ananuk; and this is enough for us.  But remember that we do not intend to use this discovery for ourselves, as per the Trithan Command.  There is no need for Yaktukans to spread to the stars, it is enough that humans in general do.”

“So you want us to test this thing and use it?”

“When it comes to that, yes, but we want you to take this to the Emperor.”

“Why can’t you do that yourself?”

“Because the Emperor’s ways are objectionable to Yaktuki, and we want nothing to do with him.  Neither do you for that matter, but you do nothing about it.”

Ananuk scoffed, “and what do you do, Rabik?  You share your farm produce and your scientific advances with his other regions; you let his fleets patrol your skies and man your borders; you even pay him a tax out of the very resources he allocates to you, just like all other regions do!  Or do you think that in not going to him yourself you are committing great rebellion?”

“There is a fundamental difference between what you do and what we do, friend Ananuk.  You serve the Emperor to protect yourselves, to ensure that the fleets that guard your borders do not attack your cities in turn.  You serve him so you do not have to waste resources on military expenditures.  We, on the other hand, serve the Emperor plainly because it falls under the codes of the Command.  We are not to build armies and maintain fleets, even though we do have the resources to do so; we are to share our produce so that our human brethren in the other regions are not starved; and we do not keep our sciences to ourselves because human interests come first.”

“Yet you block my searches about Yaktukan science.”

Rabik raised his eyebrows in bewilderment, “What’s that?”

“I guess you wouldn’t know about this, but on my way here I was idly conducting some searches on my database.  I keyed in ‘Yaktukan science’, and there was data withholding.”

“Oh I do know about that, Ananuk; the fact is that you are merely a part of the KSA, and that holds nothing for our Datacon. Had the same search been made by a member of the Imperial Group, this would not have happened.  I have no qualms in admitting that we are secretive when it comes to our science, but secretive does not mean deceptive, my friend.”

“Coming as this is from you, I’ll accept it.  But if I take this to the Emperor, I want an understanding with you.”

“There is always an understanding between us, friend Ananuk.”

“I mean a specific understanding.”

“Name it.”

“That Kadorra and Yaktuki are on the same side, Rabik.  I cannot speak for the other regions, but we are as weary of the Emperor as you are.  If the Trithan Command is a valid reason for you to not retaliate, then concern for our homes and lives is valid enough for us.  I want to know that you, and all of Yaktuki, understand this.”

“I do, my friend, coming as this is from you; and perhaps all of Yaktuki could too.  But what I don’t understand is that why is this so important?”

“Think about it Rabik, if this discovery is as potent as you promise it is, then the world is about to change.  Do you think the Emperor will be able to keep a hold on all the planets we might colonize?  His control is going to spread thin, and your twin region Vaktuki will be quick to take advantage.  I don’t want us to get confused between ally and enemy in those times.”

Rabik smiled, a faint twinkle in his eyes.  “You need not have worried, my friend.  Our regional misconceptions about each other notwithstanding; it is Kadorra that Yaktuki has called on first, and it is Kadorra that Yaktuki asks of for assistance.”

“Then I will go to the Emperor.”

The next morning Ananuk found himself back in his aerial, flying west further north to the Imperial Capital, Ingika; seat of the Emperor.  Below him was the vast Yaktukan Ocean, teeming with multitudinous species, many of which had not yet been discovered.  Even here, the Yaktukans had spread their twisted, mangled architecture.  He made out sharp towers rising out of the waters, their grisly metallic branches in stark contrast to the trees that lined the shore he had just left behind.  For hours there was nothing but the ocean, and then he spotted small patches of land among the waters.  These, he knew, were the beginnings of the southern islands of Ahurun, the only region that submitted itself to the Emperor willingly apart from Ditana, and Ingika itself, which was further north, and further west.  

The aerial was flying too high for him to discern anything on the Ahurunian lands, but once in a while he thought he could make out their megalevitators stick their heads above the clouds.  The landmass ended soon, followed by the ocean again; and he knew that much of Ahurun laid to the east of the path his pilot had chosen.  This part of the ocean was devoid of any signs of human activity.  Once or twice he caught a primamatsya jump out of the waters, float idly for a few moments, and sink back in.  He kept an eager watch after that for the turanigyak, the primamatsya’s arch rival, but the creature did not oblige. 

By the time the Thean Sun began to set on the horizon behind him, his pilot started the descent into Ingikan airspace.  Even as Head of KSA, Ananuk had never gotten the chance to visit Ingika; the Emperor never having called upon him.  To a Kadorran who was new to Ingika, its jumbled and chaotic City proper came as a total shock.  By the time his pilot was halting the aerial on the landing strip, he was aware of the heavily polluted air outside.  Still, when he exited the aerial what first hit him was not the pollution, but the cacophony of noise.  He could hear loud transport horns from every direction, and they were accompanied by regular booms that could only come from the region’s infamous Quantafactories.  It took a while for him to get used to the assault on his auditory sense, and he was relieved when he was inside the Aerialport terminal, which cut out all noise from alfresco.  



He called his counterpart from the Ingikan Science Agency who promptly sent over an aerial transport to take him to the Imperial Sector.  The ride inside the aerial was dreadful, with the pilot weaving carelessly between traffic and structures alike.  Adding to that was the outside din that the aerial did not suppress quite as well as the Aerialport terminal did.  When the pilot took a transport tunnel and the aerial switched to autodrive, Ananuk heaved a sigh of relief.  

With the aerial hovering harmlessly through the tunnel, his attention shifted to the city outside.  There was a general aura of decay about the structures and even the transports.  He spotted many minilevitators that were not exactly suspended still, and bobbing dangerously in the air.  Quantafactories were mercilessly spewing out fumes that were giving their filtration-drones a hard time.  Then, to his left, a large blank barrier emerged, blocking his view.  His aerial turned sharp left and immediately the scene to his right changed.  The levitators were much crisper, and there was no sign of the Quantafactories.  The only aerials he spotted were in the tunnels above and below him, with quite a few ground transports that seemed to be moving at high velocities.  The barrier to his left continued until the tunnel turned sharp left again, into an opening in the barrier.

Ananuk was plunged into near total darkness for a brief while, during which the aerial seemed to pick up speed.  A slight hum told him that the pilot had regained control of the aerial, but before he could worry about that, a mechanical and monotonous voice broke through the audiocomp of the aerial.

“Welcome to the Imperial Sector on Ingika.  In a moment you will arrive at the Security Gate.  You are requested to co-operate with the security drones, which reserve the right to deny you entry.  Should you show any signs of aggression or violence, immediate and punishing action will be taken.”

No sooner had the voice ended that light flooded the aerial again.  When his eyes readjusted Ananuk found that the aerial was out of the tunnel and approaching what he made out to be the Security Gate.  He was the Head of the KSA, and he had official sanction, so he had nothing to worry about.  But the oddly mechanical voice and the prospect of automated drones as security made his stomach churn, much to his embarrassment.  As he passed the first barrier of the Security Gate, he could not help but wonder if he would be able to leave the same way he came in.

#### 3

'If an agency Head was put through so many intimidating security checks', he wondered, 'what must it be like for lesser men?'  Yet, after what seemed like many hours, he found himself standing in a large hall, facing a seemingly endless span of area.  The guards had quietly gestured him in and without a glance inside the room closed the seal that now lay behind him.  The hall was dimly lit, and on the walls near the distant ceiling he could see nevon powered lamps hung at equal distances from each other.  One light shone directly below to a huge podium, where the Emperor, Ananuk realized with a jolt, was seated.  

He prostrated ritually, and when he looked up he saw the Emperor beckon silently for him to come forward.  Head still bent slightly in obeisance, he took careful, measured steps towards the Emperor, Sarvaraj the Fifth.  He felt, rather than saw, the nevon lamps behind him turn off as he passed them, making the hall behind him darker.  Up ahead, he knew, the Emperor was patiently waiting for him to approach.  When he was near enough to the podium, he stopped, and took one final bow, kneeling down to touch his forehead on the first step of the pulpit. 

When he rose up straight, he took his first, good look at the Emperor.  It was impossible to know what his real physical structure was like.  The Emperor wore armour so huge and redoubtable that no part of his body was visible.  His helmet three times the size of Ananuk’s head, and the visor was nevon blue from outside, so that the eyes were not visible.  The helmet rested on the powerful shoulders of the shield that covered the Emperor’s neck, down the shoulders, all the way to his wrists.  His hands were protected by metal alloy gloves that, Ananuk had read, immune to damage.  Similar impressive armour covered the Emperor’s torso down to his abdomen, and the legs were protected by a material similar to the gloves.  When he stood tall, with all his armour, the Emperor was eight feet tall and four feet wide.    

The Emperor’s voice was loud and deep, matching the magnificence of his appearance perfectly, “Ananuk Vikratik, Head, Kadorran Science Agency.  What brings you to my hall?”

“A matter of exciting possibilities, Emperor Sarvaraj.  I come to you with reports of a potent new discovery, carrying the success of our Yaktuki brethren.”

The Emperor spoke slowly and patiently, almost soothingly, “and why haven’t the Yaktukans come to me themselves?”

“They are bound by their Trithan Command, Emperor, and can only do what it permits.”

“Is this Trithan Command greater than the Imperial Command, Vikratik?”

“Not to me, Emperor, but perhaps to them.”

“But why send you?”

“Kadorra and Yaktuki are neighbors, Emperor.  We have a long history of initial conflict but everlasting affinity.  It is but natural that they seek our assistance.”


The Emperor was silent for a while, as if deciding whether Ananuk’s explanation satisfied him.  “Very well, Vikratik, speak what you have come to speak.”

“The Yaktukans, my Emperor, have discovered a mirror universe, lying directly below the plane of our own.  They have devised a method by which we can use this new universe to transport us where our current ships cannot.”

“Beyond our star system?”

“Yes, Emperor.  This is a discovery of great potential, and may change our fate forever.”

“Indeed, Vikratik, but what more can you tell me?  Explain things to me in detail, Kadorran, I will grasp them I assure you.”

Ananuk bowed is acceptance of the command.  “Emperor Sarvaraj, let me give you the case of the planet Edoran, which lies in the binary star system Wetraki.  Wetraki lies more than three light-years away from our star system, and is thus, impossible to reach.  But both the KSA and the Vaktukan Science Quarters have determined that Edoran might be perfectly suitable for human habitation.  For one, it has an atmosphere of eighteen percent prana-vayu, which is adequate for human respiration.  Moreover, it has a surface cover of water of around fifty four percent, again, adequate for our energy needs.”

“This is all known to me, Vikratik, where does the mirror universe come in?”

“The mirror universe can help us reach Edoran, Emperor.  Using the Reflecting Conductors the Yaktukans have built, we can shoot a chunk of matter across to the mirror universe, at a proper angle, and the matter will be deflected onto Edoran.”

“That sounds more like magic, and less like science, Vikratik.”

“Except that we know how and why this will work, Emperor; so it is not magic, but science.”

“Has this been tested?”

“No, Emperor, it has not.  The Yaktukans will not test it themselves, but are confident that it will work.  But with your permission, the KSA is more than willing to conduct the necessary tests.”

“Relay this database onto my systems, Vikratik, and I will have my scientists examine the details.  If they are satisfied, you will have your permission.”

“I will relay it the moment I get back to Kadorra, Emperor.”

Emperor Sarvaraj fell silent again.  Ananuk waited patiently for him to say something, but he did not.

“Emperor?”

“No, I may not be Emperor for long.”

“Why do you say that, Emperor?”

The Emperor jeered, “Do not pretend ignorance.  I understand the potential consequences of this discovery.  How will I, with regions under sullen resentment on this very planet, manage to hold a leash when humanity spreads beyond?”

It was Ananuk’s turn to be silent.

“But it is important that I do, do you not see?  If the Empire dissolves, the six regions will find it difficult to maintain the current peace.  With their infighting, we will have only a scattered and divided expansion, quite unlike how we have dreamed for centuries.”

In spite of himself, Ananuk realized that the Emperor was right.  It was another matter if the current Empire was not acceptable to most regions; but to have an organized expansion and to arrange a coordinated use of the new technology a uniting governing force was essential.  

“I would like to know what you are thinking, Vikratik.”

“I must admit, Emperor, that you are right.  But in this technology lies the very key to your power.  Let the use be directed through your hands, let regions come to you to employ it.”

The Emperor, interested, sat up straight.  “Continue.”

“Set up a system, Emperor, whereby you regulate the colonization of planets.  See to it that each region gets a fair amount of planets to colonize for itself.  Your power on Thea will not wane as regions turn their attention to the colonies, yet in having sovereign control over the technology, you will ensure that each region needs your allegiance.  This will prevent any from even thinking of rebelling against you.”

“And will the Yaktukans let me monopolize the use of this technology?”

“The Yaktukans have no desire to use it, Emperor.  They have no want for expanding and are quite satisfied with keeping their own borders safe.  It will be easy to convince them to hand over the technology to you.”

“And what is there in this arrangement for you, Ananuk Vikratik?”

“This will work both ways, Emperor.  The regions, including Kadorra, will have a more or less free hand in the colonies.  They will gain the autonomy there that they so arduously desire.  Kadorra, with the reverence it holds across all Thea as a holy and blessed land, will continue to prosper in that direction; while the Kadorran people will find new lands to expand.”

The, Emperor smiled indulgently, “a wise, and perhaps too wise, proposition.  But we go too far ahead.  Send me the database, let my scientists examine it, and let me decide if I allow you to conduct the tests.  Then we will think about how I handle my leash beyond the confines of Thea.”

“Very well, Emperor.  The database will be relayed to you.”

The Emperor nodded, “you may go now, Vikratik.”

Back on his aerial, on his way back to Kadorra, Ananuk’s mind was in a daze.  He had been on a brainwave back there with the Emperor, and half the things he said he had never thought of before.  But now, in the familiar and comfortable surroundings of his aerial, he realized that much of what he said was true, and it made sense.  The system he had proposed was one that was likely to keep all sides happy; and it would help strike a balance between the expanding human groups.  

“Call up the Yaktukans,” he said to his pilot, “ask for permission to enter their territory.  I want to go there before we go to Kadorra.”

“Yes, sir,” his pilot obeyed, after a few moments of silence he replied, “permission has been granted, sir.  I am making the necessary route adjustments.”


His mind now reeling with what was quickly becoming an elaborate plan in his head, Ananuk had no time to view out his window.  He instead worked on his polymachine, furiously putting together the database he was to relay to the Emperor.  It couldn’t be complete without inputs from Rabik, and he hoped that the latter would see the merit in Ananuk’s plan.  He sent in a quick message to Rabik, who was waiting for him at the Air Fields when he landed.  They took the ground transports to Rabik’s residence, where another Yaktukan was waiting for them- Admiyogi Faolvay.

“Welcome back, Sir Ananuk,” Faolvay began, “I trust your swift return means some success?”

“It does indeed, Faolvay.  And you must stop calling me ‘sir’.”

Faolvay smiled, “I was wondering if you would ever make that request, Ananuk”

“I was looking for the right moment to, Faolvay.  But we must act quickly; it will not be long before the Emperor thinks about all that I have told him, and decide that he can use force to wrest the technology from us.”

Rabik’s eyebrows shot up, “when he knows that he will have it anyhow?”

“We cannot put it past him, Rabik, and there is much that we need to arrange before we hand this over.”

“I gather you have a plan in mind, Ananuk,” said Faolvay.

“I do indeed, Faolvay.  And we need to get onto it fast.”

Faolvay made an allowing gesture, “then tell us what to do, Ananuk.”

Ananuk handed over a visodisk to Rabik, “this holds the database on the discovery, Rabik.  I need you to you check it and make any necessary additions.  Withhold nothing; there is nothing that we need to hide from the Emperor.”

Rabik took the visodisk and departed to his office-cabin.  When he was gone, Ananuk turned to Faolvay.

“The last time Rabik and I spoke, Faolvay, I mentioned to him that the use of this technology will have repercussions on the Empire.”

Faolvay nodded, “I realized this when our scientists first approached this discovery.”

“What’s more, Faolvay, is that the Emperor realizes this too.  He thought of it almost right after I explained the discovery to him.”

“This would explain your eagerness in getting down to business just now.”

Ananuk nodded, “yes.  Now when he mentioned this to me I had a sudden insight into the whole issue, and without thinking twice about anything I suggested to him a detailed plan.  The more I think about this plan now, the more I feel that it would work to the benefit of all; including Yaktuki and Kadorra.”

“Then I would be interested in hearing more about it, Ananuk.”

“It is most likely that as we colonize planets the hold of the Emperor will grow weak.  But without a central unifying force like the Empire the expansion will be hampered by numerous conflicts between the six regions.  We can count Ingika and Ahurun to be against us on all counts, and Ditana and Vaktuki will make their allegiances as dictated by self-interests.”

“I agree so far, friend Ananuk.”

“But if we let the Emperor regulate the use of the Reflectiverse, if we let each journey go through his permission, we ensure that no region rebels against him after expansion and his over-hand will ensure any infighting.”

“I see how that would work.”

“As the expansion continues, the Empire itself will be inevitably confined on Thea, whereas the component regions will spread out to their satisfaction.  A weak, but existent Empire on Thea will serve to ensure peaceful or at least conflict-less expansion of humanity.”

“What did the Emperor think of all this, Ananuk?”

“Who knows what really went on in his mind, but he admitted approval.”

“And what happens if the technology falls into the wrong hands?  Or is cut off to a select region?”

Ananuk let that question sink in.  “That’s where you come in, Faolvay.  I want Kadorra to secretly retain the technological ability for this discovery.”

“Deception…”

“Not deception, mere precaution.  I am not saying that we will surreptitiously use the technology to our benefit; Kadorra has its sense of morals too, Faolvay; we will go through the Imperial channel like the rest of the regions.  But by having a backup capability we will provide a safety net if the technology were to be misused or withheld.”

“When did you manage to think up all this, Ananuk?”

Ananuk shrugged helplessly, “it came to me, Faolvay; if you can believe that.  But look, irregardless of what Yaktuki in general feels, I know that Rabik in his heart is confident this technology will work; and to be honest, that is enough for me.  In the right time, of course, it needs to be and it will be tested.  But the time to prepare for a changed world has arrived, and I want to be ahead of others.”

“So you want us to in fact prepare two databases.  One will faithfully go to the Emperor, while the other will remain with you.”

“That is exactly what I want, Faolvay.  But more than that, I also want your trust.  I do not seek an upper hand from other regions, nor do I want Kadorra to develop as the most powerful.  But I do think that a backup should remain in the hands of someone trustworthy; and I can think of no one more so than myself.”

“Valid enough, Ananuk; this will be done.”

##### VAKTUKI-

“Trust the Yaktukans to come up with something like this and take it to the Kadorrans first,” complained Chief Regulator Kinan Retrapi.  

“What else would you expect, Kinan?  Our questionable political stance and motives do not inspire trust in any region,” reasoned his aide, Utaril Tripun. 

Utaril’s appearance was far too unassuming to look convincingly Vaktukan.  He was mostly bone, with flesh added as an afterthought.  His gangly long fingers and an adam’s apple that protruded most insistently from a long neck were a far cry from the typical Vaktukan muscle and strength.  His straight eyes were a contrast among a people whose distinguishing characteristic was the prominent slant in the eyes.  The first Vaktukans and many generations following had swum across the great ocean from Yaktuki; setting up camps on the small islands that were strewn across the ocean.  As a result, Vaktukans even now had feet that were flat and flippery; but somehow Utaril lacked even those.  But physical appearances apart, Utaril was a capable, intelligent, and loyal Vaktukan, and that was enough for Kinan to appoint him as chief aide.

 
“But we are twin regions, are we not, Utaril?  Vaktuki was founded by the brother of their beloved Tritha.  Does that not count for anything?”

“It would have, Kinan, when the planet was young and the brothers still roamed its lands.  But Vaktuki is ruled by the Retrapis now, and the Admiyogi of Yaktuki has no connection to you.”

“It would still have counted for something in my eyes.”

“But it does not translate in your actions, my CR.  Yaktuki does not know that we are, or whether we ever were, planning rebellion.  Neither does it know what we intend to do if and when we overthrow the Emperor.  You might be the political descendant of Tritha Vaktuki, but not his blood descendant.  This counts a lot for the Yaktukans.”

“And are their Admiyogis blood descendants of the brothers, Utaril?”

“They are sanctioned regulators, Kinan, whereas the Retrapis are the clan that emerged out of bloody succession struggles that ensued after Vaktuki’s death.  There is an underlying difference.”

Kinan fell silent, defeated.  His slanted, tiny eyes drew together in an expression of anger, and the cords of his tied hair stretched visibly tighter as his frowning forehead pulled the scalp forward.  In true Vaktukan fashion, they were in a chamber buried many feet below the ground.  Aerials that passed through Vaktukan airspace saw only barren fields and rugged mountain ranges, with occasional clumps of wasted and lifeless forests.  Vaktuki was a peninsula joined by land only on its eastern borders, neighboured by the region of Ditana.  It was Tritha Vaktuki who first crossed the ocean from the west and discovered the region.  

“Sulking will do no good, CR.  The Yaktukans may have ‘betrayed’ us, so to speak; but it is comforting to know that neither Yaktuki nor Kadorra will ever go against us.  Our military superiority notwithstanding, both regions will try to avoid conflict as much as they can.  And they will never submit to the Emperor willingly.  Moreover, the cultural soft power we hold in the eyes of the Kadorrans and Yaktukans will inevitably influence their political decisions.”

“But with this Reflectiverse Technology in the hands of the Emperor, we are defeated, Utaril.”

“If you make Thea the center of your universe, CR; but with the RT’s help Thea is no longer the center of the universe.  Already the Kadorran scientist, Ananuk, readies his team to journey to Edoran, and it won’t be long before we will get to send our first team.”

“You mean to say that Thea is no longer important?”

“It is not, CR; not anymore.  Our technologies and people can be transported to off-planet colonies.  We will build newer, better Vaktukis, away from the Emperor’s outstretches claws.”

“And what will become of our original homeland, Utaril?”

“What of it?  Vaktukans are more important than Vaktuki itself, Kinan.”

“But to the Vaktukans themselves it is Vaktuki that is important.”

“To the Vaktukans of this generation, my CR, yes; but what of coming generations?  What of the many Vaktukans that will now be born on different planets.  Will they relate themselves to the original Vaktukan land?  To Thea?”

“You look too far ahead, Utaril.  The first generation of Vaktukan colonizers will forever be psychologically rooted on Thea.  Their children and grand-children will make many visits to the original land.  It will take quite a few generations for the aura to wear off.  I cannot afford to let Vaktuki decay and weaken while its colonies grow stronger.  By the theory you expound, who’s to say that the Vaktukan colonies will always be loyal to Vaktuki itself?  Or Thea, for that matter?”

“You include unnecessary variables, my CR.”

“As do you.  Thea, as the source and root of this impending expansion, will indeed be the center of the universe as far as humanity is concerned.  And we will be foolish to assume otherwise.”

“Perhaps so, my CR.  In which case, what do you propose to do?”

“I will call upon the Yaktukans, and as for the technology to be handed over to us, not the Emperor.”

“You think they will comply?”

“I cannot say, Utaril, but I intend to be as persuasive as I can.”

“You will threaten hostilities?”

Kinan shook his head sideways, “Quite the opposite, in fact.  I will call on our ancient alliance, on the kinship of our founding fathers.”

Utaril smiled disdainfully, “You are an idealist if you think that will work, Kinan.  The old alliances have long worn off, as I just explained to you.”

“But they are not dead, Utaril, they can be renewed; and there lies the chance for my persuasion.”

##### YAKTUKI-

“This is not entirely unprecedented, Rabik.”

“I must admit, Faolvay, that it missed my foresight.  But what do we do now?”

“I wonder, Rabik, if Retrapi has advisors on his side to remind him that we are not brethren regions anymore.  I want to know whether he makes this move despite their advice, or because he has no advice.”

“I don’t see how this is important, Faolvay.”

“It is important because it will help us judge Retrapi better, Rabik.  If he has not been reminded this, then perhaps I can grant him more innocence.  But if he has been reminded, and he moves in spite of it, then if would grant a touch of aggression.”

“If the case is the latter, Faolvay?”

“It would be even easier then to trust Ananuk.”

“And if it is the former?”

“I would trust Ananuk even then, but it will help us judge the future actions of Retrapi better.”

“Forgive me, Faolvay, but I must ask again; what do we do now?”

“I have just answered that, Rabik.  We will stand with Ananuk no matter what.”

“And what will we say to Retrapi?”

“The truth, Rabik.  Despite our old alliances we cannot trust Vaktuki at the moment.  I will personally inform the Vaktukan Chief Regulator that our loyalty lies only to the Trithan Command.”

“And if he gets hostile?”

“The Trithan Command does not prohibit self defense.”

“Neither does it assure success, Faolvay.”

“But it commands courage, and both Yaktuki and its Admiyogi have enough of that, Rabik.”

Rabik bowed his head in obeisance, “No Yaktukan doubts that, my Admiyogi.”

“Nor was I suggesting that you do, Rabik.  Now put in the call to Retrapi, and let me speak to him.”

There were a few moments of silence while Rabik called Retrapi through the intraplanetary live communication system.  After a while the pony tailed head of Kinan Retrapi appeared on the visoscreen facing Faolvay, with a curious smile on his face.  

“Good evening, Chief Regulator,” greeted Faolvay.

“Good evening to you as well, Admiyogi Faolvay.  I gather you have received my request?”

“I have indeed, CR. But I must inform you with sincere regrets that it is not a request we can meet.”

Retrapi frowned, “why is that, Admiyogi?”

“Because what you request is that we deceive the Emperor and the other regions, CR.  And deception is not permitted under the Trithan Command.”

“We Vaktukans too honor and revere the Command, Admiyogi, but what I request is not a deception but a mere precaution.  It would be unwise to let only one hand control the technology that your scientists have devised.”

“You are right, CR; but what makes you think that only the Emperor will have the control and ability?”

“Who else will then, Admiyogi?  The Kadorrans?”

“No, CR, not the Kadorrans, but the Yaktukans themselves.”

Retrapi made a face, “That is not what I mean, Admiyogi.  Yaktuki should anyways retain the ability of this technology, but we both know that Yaktuki does not intend to use it for itself.”

“And if I accede to your request, then Vaktuki does intend to use it?”

“For the mutual advantages of both regions, Admiyogi.”

“The regions have no mutual advantages, CR.”

“Of course they do, Admiyogi Faolvay.  It is in the interests of both to have the Emperor’s power dwindle, and to keep the Ingikans and Ditanians considerably weaker.”

“You are mistaken, CR, if you think that such matters are of concern to Yaktuki.  If they were, we would not have involved the Emperor, or even Kadorrans, into the matter.”

“Admiyogi Faolvay,” reasoned Retrapi, “the world is going to change with the advent of this technology; as you very well know.  Does Yaktuki intend to forever stick to its line of neutrality and reluctant interference?”

“As far as we can, CR Retrapi.”

Retrapi recline back in exasperation, “But that is ill-judged, Admiyogi.  How can you see yourselves existing among five regions that are continuously expanding?”

“By maintaining that very policy of neutrality and reluctant interference, CR.  Our sincere disinterest will safeguard us against the hostilities of the other regions.”

“And have you no desire to expand for yourselves?”

“And embroil us in further political and economic complications?  No, Sir Retrapi, I’d rather we not.”

“Is that what all of Yaktuki feels?”

“Chief Regulator, as far as you are concerned, I am all of Yaktuki.”

“And you will not consider my request?”

“I have considered it, but I must politely decline.”

A shrewd look entered Retrapi’s eyes, plainly visible through the visoscreen, “But the ability that you will retain, will that be available to Vaktuki in times of need?”

“Who will judge that need, CR?”

“All of Yaktuki, Admiyogi Faolvay.”

Faolvay smiled dourly, “You would trust my judgment then?”

“I don’t trust it even now, but I must accept it.”

“We will retain the ability, CR, precisely to insure that no region is unjustly treated by the Emperor.”

“Does our common history not matter at all, Admiyogi Faolvay?”

“Only so that I would feel better aiding Vaktuki in times of distress more than Ingika or Ditana, or even Ahurun.”

“And Kadorra?”

“You are insistent on knowing of our relationship, Chief Regulator.”

“And you seem insistent on hiding it, Admiyogi Faolvay.”

“But I have nothing to hide.  Kadorra and Yaktuki are neighbors and allies from a time before when Tritha Vaktuki first cross the ocean.  He set foot on banks of the Kadorran Holy Lake long before he did on the Vaktukan shores.  We are but natural allies, CR.”

“Is that why you went to the Emperor through Kadorra?”

“It is only part of the reason, CR.  A bigger reason is that our scientists have collaborated with the Kadorran Science Agency on many occasions, to much success.  On the other hand the Vaktukan Science Center has clung to its secrets most arduously.”

“The Center complains the same of you, Admiyogi Faolvay.”

“That is baseless.  Yaktuki has always shared its science impartially.  The Reflectiverse technology is a recent example, CR.”

“My Center maintains that there is also science that you do not share.”

Faolvay frowned, “I cannot allow for such accusations, Chief Regulator.  I repeat again that our actions are all guided by the Trithan Command; if you cannot believe that, then you will find very few reasons to trust Yaktuki at all,” he concluded.

“Is that your final stand?”

“My stand has been clear from the start.”

Faolvay saw Retrapi stand up and reach towards his own communication device.  “So be it, Admiyogi Faolvay.”  The visoscreen went blank as Retrapi closed the connection from his side.

#### 5

“It simply can’t be miniaturized further, Ananuk.  This is as far as we can go.”  The bold, deep voice of the deputy Head, Hitaruk Puranim, complained through Ananuk’s visotalk.

“Then we would have to have a crew size of at least ten, Hitaruk.”

“Yes I realize that, but there is nothing more that can be done.  Even with removing the energy sources and installing terraredundancy algorithms the size still remains sixty percent of the original Conductor.”

“But a crew of ten will mean more men will venture into unknown territories and risk their well being.”

“Ananuk, I realize all this, I reassure you; but you tell me what more do we do?  We removed the outer shelling too, replacing it with a talitium alloy skeleton.”

“All right, Hitaruk, that is the best we can do I guess.”

“It is.  Do we have the men ready?”

“Twenty of them have been training for this since we got the Emperor’s permission.  Gotranik Pulmanim, the chief geologist, is a must; as is his sister, Yutarikin, the gasiologist.  Apart from them we’ll need two mobile experts and two habitation engineers.  Counting you and me, that’ll be eight.”

“There will need to be two more people who are as familiar with the Reflecting Conductor as you and I are, Ananuk.”

“Why?”

“What if something happens to us?  If it’s only us and something happens the others might not be able to operate it correctly, and they will be stranded; or worse.  The people on Thea will only assume the worse.”

“I see your point, Hitaruk.  Do you have anyone in mind?”

“Chitrakin Ruvitin is the most capable, Ananuk.  She has grasped the workings of the Conductor so well that I feel she is way ahead of even me.”

“And the second?”

“Are none of the Yaktukans interested, Ananuk?”

“None that I know of; why?”

“Well, I was thinking of Rabik.  He probably knows more than all of us combined, and I wouldn’t doubt his capability for a minute.”

“I could talk to him, though I don’t think much will come out of that.  There may well be some obscure Yaktukan scientist who would like to get involved; but I don’t think Rabik is inclined to get involved.”

“Well you talk to him, and if it doesn’t work out, we’ll think of someone.”

“But we don’t have much time, Hitaruk.  The Emperor grows impatient, as do Vaktuki and Ditana.  The longer we take the greater the chances of this slipping out of our hands.”

“It will still take us another week to get the Conductor ready, Ananuk.  We’ll decide on the tenth member within the next couple of days so that the final crew has a little time to get to terms with themselves.”

“Sounds good, Hitaruk.”

Ananuk removed the visotalk from his ear and reattached it to his polymachine.  Things had happened very quickly once the Emperor’s permission came through.  Ananuk had feared that of all regions, Vaktuki would protest vehemently against Kadorra carrying out the first test; but to his surprise Retrapi had remained mysteriously silent.  The Yaktukans, true to their word, had already prepared two ability modules.  The first was secretly carried back to Kadorra and hidden by Ananuk; the second was presented to the Emperor in full regional view.  When the official Emperor Order came, Ananuk received the second module from the Emperor and brought it back to Kadorra to begin preparing for the test.

The first part was deciding upon the test target.  Edoran was the most suitable, but there were other planets as well, most notably Toladri and Halitar.  Once they agreed on Edoran, Ananuk insisted on keeping the crew size as low as possible.  This was hampered by the size and complexity of the Reflecting Conductor the Yaktukans had built, which was part of the ability module.  While Ananuk headed the team that would observe Edoran magnitele-visually, his deputy Hitaruk set upon reducing the size of the Conductor.  

That had been two weeks ago, and after his talk with Hitaruk today, Ananuk knew that the test day was fast approaching.  Much of the magnitele-visual analysis had revealed nothing new, and the Reflecting Conductor had been miniaturized as much as possible.  There would still have to be the official meetings with the Emperor and Regions Council, which Ananuk was not looking forward to.  

His polymachine sounded an urgent notification.  He flicked on the sightscreen and put the visotalk back in his ear.  

Elective One Karuntak Karunik’s soft, paternal face broke onto the screen.  “How are you, Ananuk?” he asked in his soft, soothing voice.

“Doing well so far, Elective.”

“I’m afraid this call might change that a bit.”

“How so?”

“Have you decided upon your crew, Ananuk?”

“I just finished talked to Hitaruk about that, Elective, and we’ve just about decided.”

“Just about?”

“We’re thinking of a tenth member.  I have fourteen capable Kadorrans that have been training, and one of them is going to make it.”

“I’m afraid not, Ananuk,” the Elective One rejoined; his pleasant face looking odd adopting a grave expression.

“Why is that?”

“The Vaktukans have influenced the Emperor slightly, and they want one of their men in this too.”

“But that’s absurd; this test is being conducted by the KSA.”

“Yes but it is being done for all of Thea.  I think that is the argument that Chief Regulator Retrapi pitted.  He contended that one of his men join the crew to insure a full report and no secrecy on the part of Kadorra.”

“And the Emperor agreed?”

“Seems so, since we just got an Imperial Command about this.”

“But now the other regions are going to want to do the same!”

“But they won’t manage like Retrapi did, and he has the military might to bend the Emperor to his will, occasionally.”

“Do we know who he is sending?”

“His chief aide, Utaril Tripun.”

“I’ve never heard of him.”

“I have, at previous Emperor and Region Councils.  He’s intelligent, sharp, articulate, and fiercely Vaktukan.”

“Is he safe?”

“I cannot say.  It is rumored that he has a nice hold over Retrapi, and much of Vaktuki’s policies are actually formulated by him.  But on the other hand, Ananuk, he is also quite capable.  He’s a Thinker and Quantum Vedics and Planetary History, apart from being a Postulator in Thean Biology, Vaktukan Politic, and Stellar Astronomy.”

“That’s quite a handful,” Ananuk commented sourly.  

“I agree, but it means that he will be a helpful hand.”

“If he intends to be helpful, Elective.” 

“True,” Elective One agreed.  “So; Edoran…”

“Yes, Edoran.  Quite suitable for the first run.”

“There’s a chance it may contain native species, Ananuk.”

“Yes there is, but not native intelligent species.  Our neighboring planets Magrea and Tshea are home to numerous insect species and even a few mammalians, but none intelligent.”

“And what do you intend to do if you encounter intelligence?”

“I regard that as mere romantic speculation, Elective.  Even if we consider the Quarm’s Equation as accurate there is no possibility of intelligence on Edoran.  It may be more probable once we leave this galaxy but we don’t mean to go that far just as yet.”  

“Yes; I suppose you are right, Ananuk.  I have long forgotten my Thinker’s course in Probability Cosmology.”

Ananuk smiled mischievously, “matters little in your field of work now, Elective.”

The Elective One returned his smile genially, “Right you are, Ananuk.  And this reminds me of our upcoming session with the Emperor and Regions Council.  Are you ready?”

“Yes we are, Elective.  Has its Imperial Command come yet?”

“No, not yet, but anytime now; it’s good that you are ready.  I’ll let you get back to your work now, Ananuk; not that I do not have any of my own.”  The Elective One concluded with a twinkling smile.

Ananuk disconnected the line.  He was among the majority of Kadorrans who had voted for Karuntak Karunik during the Kadorran elections a year ago.  Karuntak was then Elective Three-A, and his closest contester, the Elective Three-D, had backed out of goodwill when he realized that Kadorra wanted Karuntak for the job.  Kinan Retrapi had come for the official coronation ceremony, but Ananuk could not remember seeing Utaril Tripun there.  He shook his head to clear his thoughts.  So often during the past month he had caught himself thinking about the near and far future more than the clear present.  He had infected Faolvay and Rabik with the same disease, even though Yaktukans claimed they were not interested in the application of the technology.  Now, with Retrapi’s latest move, he wondered if the Vaktukan Chief Regulator too was suffering from it.  Slapping his tablet hover hard, he got up, closed his window screens, and went off to take a nap.

In another room of the KSA, Gotranik Pulmanim and his sister Yutarikin were bent over a tablet hover, studying various maps, diagrams, and charts of Edoran.  The siblings had similar features- jet black, wavy hair that fell to their shoulders; light green eyes contrasted by a dark skin; and heavy, thick jaws.  Gotranik looked redoubtable and handsome; Yutarikin was attractive, thought not entirely beautiful.

“It’s hard to pinpoint where exactly on Edoran we’ll land up, but if our calculations about its spin and orbit are correct, we’re gonna end up somewhere near the great ridges.”  

“But that might not be the best place to set up the habitation, Yutari,” Gotranik countered.  He traced his finger on the chart of Edoran’s terrestrial features, “I would estimate that around two thousand yonganas north of the great ridges would lie the native forests and a large ocean.”  Gotranik traced the finger above the great ridges towards a darkly shaded area on the map.  

“If we do appear near the great ridges, Gotran, then we won’t have much choice,” Yutarikin reminded him with her soft but slightly course voice.  “It won’t be possible for us to take long distance transports when the RC is as huge as it is.”     

Gotranik nodded, “I know, I know; but the ridges will present Edoran’s harshest side to us, and we will be strained to the max.”

“What else can be done, brother?  It is possible that Hitaruk’s calculations are off, and we fall on the other side of Edoran,” Yutarikin glanced at the map, “where the features are visibly much tamer.  But if the calculations are even approximately correct, then will fall at least a thousand yonganas away from your forests.”

Gotranik frowned, and clicked over a different chart of Edoran, this one showing the great ridges in more detail.  He and Yutarikin together studied the Edoran plains as they rose in height along the banks of an invisible river from either side.  Jagged and irregular, these ridges followed the invisible river as it wriggled its way through yonganas and yonganas of land, often overlapping itself.  The over all appearance of the ridges reminded Yutarikin of the terraganglions that every Kadorran adored.  

“It would be very easy to get stuck in this invisible river, Yutari.  We won’t even be able to scale the ridges.”

“But it doesn’t really matter, Gotran.  This first run isn’t really a colonization is it?  It’s just going to be ten or twenty of us, more to test the technology rather than establish a base.”

Gotranik nodded in agreement, “Yes you are right, Yutari.  But I keep forgetting the whole process of how we’re gonna get there in the excitement of actually being there.  Think about it, sister; we will be the first humans to ever set foot on a foreign planet!”

Yutarikin grinned happily, “I know!  It’s a life changer isn’t it?”

“Totally!”

“So think about that, Gotran!  And forget trying to decide where we should appear and where the best place would be.  We have no control over that.”

“Very well, sister, I will try.”

Over the next few days, the Vaktukan, Utaril Tripun, joined Ananuk’s team.  On Hitaruk’s advice, Ananuk decided to take along only one mobiles expert, and the other was replaced by the Ahurun-born KSA astronomer, the aged Triarka Ahuri, making him the oldest member on the crew.  It wasn’t long before Ananuk called in the Emperor Sarvaraj and Elective One Karuntak on a multivisotalk conference. 

“Emperor; Elective;” he began, as they viewed him through their own screens, “we are ready to go.”

His consciousness disappeared, and it was replaced by his alter ego.  He didn’t recognize it, nor was he in a state to.  But the alter ego noted all, and remembered all.  Slowly, it gave him his thoughts back; and he tried to recall who and where he was.  But the sudden onslaught of thoughts held him back, and he bucked under their pressure, losing cognizance.  The alter ego noted this too, and decided he wasn’t very strong a creature.  It gave him another jolt of consciousness, but the mentations were unrelenting, and he drifted into unconsciousness again.  His alter ego sensed some brothers around, and it let him float prone while it sent its invisible tendrils across the void.  It found more tendrils and twisted around them, interconnecting with its kin.  But he was beginning to gain consciousness again, on his own.  Perhaps the alter ego had underestimated him.  It drifted back to him and supplied more jolts.  He was somehow prepared this time, and he held against the thought-flood.  Applying a mental filter, he let them come one at a time.  

'Who am I?'

'Triarka Ahuri.'

'Where am I?'

'In an infinite void.'

'What am I doing here?'

'Making the journey to beyond.'

He did not understand it, and under that confusion he felt an intruder penetrate inside him.  Something was probing his mind, asking questions of its own.  He wanted to fling his arms and shake his head vigorously, but he couldn’t feel his body around him.  This caused him to panic a little, and he felt the intruder growing bolder, asking deeper questions.  He tried to push it out, applying the same mental barrier he had earlier; and the intruder receded.  Just when some of his memories starting coming back to him, the intruder pierced through him sharply, and he uttered a loud scream.  At that very moment, Triarka Ahuri found himself flung across the void, and he fell onto a hard, grainy surface.  He coughed weakly, and heard more people cough similarly around him.  Somewhere behind him he heard loud thuds in quick succession.  The last thud was the loudest, and it made the ground beneath his palms shake.

“We’ve made it…” Ananuk’s faint voice carried over to Triarka.

No one said anything in reply.  Triarka’s vision was clearing up now, and through the visor of his headpod he could see the outline of someone standing up cautiously and surveying himself.  Triarka decided his legs were feeling strong enough to try standing just as yet, but he saw more of the crew getting on their feet and dusting their body tight balium protection-respiration suits; checking for damage to both body and suit.  Even through the suit, he could feel a light breeze coming from the east.  No, he couldn’t assign directions using Thean orientation; light breeze coming from his right.  Ukinak Litrakin, one of the crew’s two habitation engineers, walked up to Triarka.

“You okay, Triarka?” he asked in his hesitant, reserved voice.

Triarka waved him away.  He didn’t have the strength to speak, and all he wanted to do was find a recuperative hover and rest.  Around him the others were orienting themselves to the new world.  Some had walked over to examine the Reflecting Conductor, which had fallen out of the Reflectiverse with the ground shaking thud.  More tools and machines had fallen around the RC in their cased seals.  He could hear Ananuk and Hitaruk having an excited conversation.

“It really happened to fast for me to notice anything.”

“I know; it’s the same with me too.  One moment we activated the RC, the next moment I’m flung to the ground on Edoran.”

“Yes but didn’t you get that feeling of being stretched and compressed?”

“No, I told you, Ananuk, it happened to fast for me.”

Triarka’s attention shifted over to the crew’s mobile expert, Itharka Nihilihin who was already beginning to assemble the first transport hover.  He saw Utaril Tripun helping him guide a talitium sheet onto a circular foundation disk using a remote.  The Pulmanim siblings were walking around, and making observations on their note screens levitating near them.  His spine protesting in pain, Triarka twisted around to see the others, who were taking out the tools from their cases.  

Ukinak, Chitrakin, and the second habitation engineer- Ravitak Idyarthik, were opening up the vacuum sealed cases and de-activating their plasma fields.  When plasma fields were dry they would extract the constituent tools.  Triarka saw multimeters, visographs, televiewers, spare body suits, nutrition packs, backup oxygen pods, thermal sources, photon strips, and talitium sheets emerge from the cases.  

A hand on his left shoulder jolted Triarka to look back at the source.

“Are you okay, Triarka?” the concerned face of Ananuk eclipsed the rising Edoran sun.

“I’ll get there, Ananuk.  I’m still trying to reorient myself to this universe.”

“You’re not hurt are you?”

Triarka rested his right hand on Ananuk’s hand on his shoulder and pulled up under its weight.  Once up, he took out an aidestick from his cloak and extended it to its maximum.  Left hand resting on the stick, Triarka stood up straight.

“Nothing seems to be hurting, Ananuk.”

Ananuk smiled in relief, “that’s good, Triarka;” he motioned towards the Pulmanim siblings, “I think they want you there.  They want you to help make notes about the observable Edoran system.”

Giving Triarka another smile, Ananuk jogged over to the Reflecting Conductor, which was now being examined by Hitaruk and Chitrakin.  Triarka saw the Pulmanims waiting for him and began making his way towards them.  His senses beginning to operate normally, he noticed the landscape around him.  The Edoran sun was pulling up towards his right, and he couldn’t help but call that east, from behind a dense range of eroded and rocky mountains that stretched out far towards the eastern horizon.  He could make out distinct outlines of rivers, streams, and waterfalls running from their invisible sources through the mountain valleys up to the foothills; which began closer to where the crew stood.  Nearer the crew site the foothills faded into plain fields with a dry river beds running through them.  The mountain ranges arced along the horizon from the east all the way to the front of him, which he fixed as north. 

In that distant north he could make out the mountains fading into plains similarly, but the plains there were packed with forests that had a distinct blue hue to them.  The forests were cut off from them by a dry river bed that ran down from the eastern mountains through the plains to the western horizon, curving southwards along the way.  Behind him, to the south, he had to squint his eyes to see Ananuk, Hitaruk, Chitrakin, and the others working on their tools and components.  Beyond them the plains led to an infinite ocean that merged with the southern horizon.  Triarka almost imagined the mythical Vaunaki ship appearing on the horizon, with its talitium sails harnessing the equally mythical gravitic waves.  He turned back around and stared up at the Edoran sun, which was rising quickly to its maximum height.  The light breeze was still blowing and the climate was mild and pleasant.  Yutarikin called out to him when he was within earshot.

“Liking the breeze, Triarka?  Its going to get stronger in a few hours, we’ll have to set up habitations by then.”

“Ukinak and Ravitak will be getting to it shortly, Yutari,” he replied as he ambled over to them.

Gotranik, who was studying something on his note screen, turned to him, “we have many observations to make before the, Triarka.  Are you feeling okay?”

'Why does everyone keep asking me that?'

''“Yes; why?  Don’t I look okay?”

“Well…you just seem…weaker,”

“It must be the Reflection, Gotran.  I think I really took it bad.”

“It was a little unsettling,” agreed Yutarikin, “but you’ll be fine Triarka, don’t worry.”

'I’m not worrying.'

''Gotranik pointed to the eastern horizon, “we studied the planet’s magnetic field and that’s the magnetic north, so we’ll stick to that.  It’s a little different from the Thean system, so it’ll take time getting used to.  Edoran’s rotational axis is its east-west axis, and so the sun is rising from the north.” 

Gotranik turned around to the other side, pointing his left arm straight ahead of him.  “That’s the magnetic south, where lie the great ridges I was hoping we would avoid.  Luckily we did; we landed up safely north of the ridges, where the terrain is more hospitable and diverse.”  He gestured towards the ocean, we can call the east, I guess;” and then towards the forests, “and that the west.”



Triarka nodded, amused at himself at the directions he had assigned in his head.  He looked towards the ocean; four of the crew were walking towards them, carrying the tool cases.  As they came closer he could make them out- Ravitak, Ukinak, Itharka, and Utaril Tripun.

“Feels quite like back home doesn’t it?”  Ravitak called out pleasantly.

“Maybe,” replied Gotranik, “but I can palpably feel that I’m on a new world.”

“I agree with you, Gotran.”  Said Itharka.

“Me too, but the breeze and the distant mountains do remind me of Kadorra.”  Added Ukinak.

“Very true, Ukin.  After the effects of the Reflection wore off I did say to myself, ‘Hey!  This isn’t too different from home,’” added Yutarikin.  

“I’ve never been to Kadorra,” commented Utaril, “and have lived all my life under the ground.  So it all seems other-worldly to me.”

“I can relate to that somewhat, Master Tri-”

“Please, Triarka; call me Utaril.”

“I can relate to that somewhat, Utaril.  I spend my childhood in Ahurun, which is a most unkind terrain.”

“How was the Reflection for you, Utaril?” asked Gotranik.

“Well, a little unsettling I must say.  But nothing that one couldn’t get used to after a few tries.”

“Yea I feel the same way,” agreed Itharka.

Triarka had been trying to avoid thinking about the Reflection, observing the others to see how it had been for them.  But it became quite clear now that either some or all of them were hiding it too, or that he was the only one who experienced that alien intrusion.  He recalled the last painful stab he had felt into his mind, and felt an instant throb of pain in his head.  A feeling horribly like the unwelcome violation in the Reflectiverse over came him, and he fell to the ground, unconscious.

The alter ego’s Subentity found life.  It experienced the new world it could sense, pulsating with an energy it could not identify.  It relished in the new stimulus its being was receiving.  The waves of energy that were flooding it made it delightfully enlivened, and its vibrations found their way back to the alter ego’s Primalentity.  The Primalentity spread its tendrils across the void, connecting with its new found family.  It spread the vibrations to them and all over the void the Primalentities and Mainentities pulsated with a hitherto unknown energy.  They experienced a glimpse of the new world the Subentity had found.  Mainentities rapidly sent more vibrations of communication, and the void gathered energy as they grew more and more alive.  They created more and more Mainentities that spread across the void, expanding its infinite boundaries further.  This entangled mesh of alter ego Entities observed and noted all the vibrations of communication and gave them its own vibration, which spread to all the Primalentities and Mainentities; it became the Controlentity.

[Entities/Call/Respond,] it vibrated.

[Responding,] the Entities vibrated.

[New world/new birth/new life,] it vibrated.

It gathered knowledge from the first ten Primalentities and spread the knowledge through the void.  Mainentities absorbed the vibrations, and they knew what the Primalentities knew.  It then disconnected the Primalentities from the Mesh, keeping them linked only with itself.  The Primalentities feel into the deeper layers of the void, where their tendrils created a Submesh.  They hid that knowledge within them, and the Controlentity did not find out.  

On the main layers, within the Mesh, the Entities created pods.  The pods they connected to the Controlentity, and withdrew the Mesh away from them.  The Controlentity too fell back, and together the Entities began their wait.

[Find new sources/New energy,] the Controlentity vibrated, [Absorb new world.]

#### 7

Thick, heavy raindrops were falling hard against the metal shield of the secret Ahurunian Defense quarters, which the limited sound barriers could soften only enough.  Senior Commander Ufunlat ‘Bridge’ Thaltov was seated at the head of an interaction hover-set.  Around him were seated his Ahurunians under Command, the elite team of fifteen genetically and mechanically upgraded soldiers.  These sixteen men together were the entire military of Ahurun; but with their own upgradation technology and Vaktuki-made weaponry, they were more than sufficient.    

“Five days, men,” Commander Bridge growled; “five days to go before we set out as the first banner of Ahurunian expansion.”

He glared around the hover-set, as if to see if anyone would challenge his declaration.  No one would have dared to however.  The selection of the AuC’s Senior Commander was a rigorous and daunting procedure.  Aspirants to the job had to undergo a series of life threatening and strength measuring tasks, at the end of which the only man standing would be the only man alive.  The survivor held on to the position of SC for ten years, after which he could retire or contest again.  SC Bridge Thaltov had been the SC for thirty years running.  This very fact alone would have been enough to break the will of any man who would even dare to defy or challenge SC Bridge.  But Ahurunian society also placed a high importance to the AuC, and as such it was the most ritualized and elaborate sub-structure of the society.   Specific and general rules defined how the AuC was to interact with its SC, and how not to.  The first rule held firmly that the SC was always right.  No one was to contest any proclamation or decision that came from the SC, and his word was final.  Only the Ahurunian Regent of the Emperor was above the SC; but SC Bridge had seen seven Regents go by during his thirty years, and it was no secret that SC Bridge Thaltov was the de facto ruler of Ahurun, the real power holder.

Fifteen sharp claps hit the hover-set in precise unison, telling SC Bridge that his men had accepted his statement.  “Kadorra goes to Edoran, Vaktuki takes Daevonakri, and we have targeted Yulhin, which was discovered by our own scientists.”  

Fifteen claps again.  “Of the possibly habitable planets that are known to humans, Yulhin is the farthest- sixty two light years away.  The Regent feels that this symbolizes what Ahurun is on Thea.  We are the most isolated, harsh, and inhospitable land on Thea, are we not, men?”

He nodded at the claps.  “And so is Yulhin to the universe.  Its terrain can be best described as the Trunuhu Valley-Caves, which should be child’s play to the AuC.”

Firm claps followed.  The Trunuhu Valley-Caves lay towards the north-west border of Ahurun, among the Trunuhu Mountains.  Ahurunian legend held that during the ancient eons of Thea the Mountains were inhabited by a Trunah, the mythical majestic serpent with a body made of the divine 'daivya 'rock.  Trunahs had fallen to Thea, the legend held, through a different realm.  In the Mountains, one of them was forever chased by its own shadows; and it slithered furiously through the mountains and beneath the surface, running from itself.  In this process it created what came to be known as the Trunuhu Valley-Caves.  From above, the Valley-Caves resembled the site of a battle between giant drilling rollers.  The soaring Mountains were scarred with valleys that simply disappeared underground and emerged out elsewhere.  It was claimed that the jagged, sharp cuts on the surface and in the caves was made by Trunah’s razor-scaled body as it had slithered past.  These sharp cuts made it near impossible to gain footholds or fingerholds if one was trying the cross the terrain.  The only humans known to have made it through the Trunuhu Valley-Caves were the AuC trainees, the survivors of the SC selection process, and the ancient wanderers- Tritha Yaktuki and Tritha Vaktuki.

“Permission to speak, Commander Bridge?”

SC Bridge’s eyes glanced at the source of the request.  It was AuC Rafiyal ‘Cream’ Gomnat, the SC’s champion officer and a fierce Ahurun patriot.  AuC Cream was the successful product of a new mental modification program the Ahurunian scientists had recently tested.  His pain receptors had been removed from their lobes, and most of his mind’s ability to question “why?” had been taken away.  The latter was slightly redundant, given that no AuC ever dared to ask “why?” to his SC anyways; except AuC Ritam ‘Lesson-for-All’ Deypan.  Lesson-for-All’s real nickname had been forgotten soon after he was obliterated for asking his SC why he should climb past the Trunuhu Mountains.  So as AuC Cream asked for permission to speak, SC Bridge sincerely hoped that his most valuable officer would refrain from uttering the forbidden three letter word.  

“Permission granted, Cream,” he growled; eyes trying to pierce through Cream’s multipurpose visor.

“The men under my direct command,” began Cream in his steely, mechanical voice, “AuCs Empty and Stacy have spent the past few months infiltrating Kadorra, masquerading as Kadorrans, and then traveling to Edoran.  You will find their reports highly interesting, Commander.”

SC Bridge eyed Cream sorrowfully, but the look was hidden behind his own multipurpose visor.  AuC Cream had the makings of an SC, no doubt; but he was rash and hasty.  He had made himself noticed too early in his life, and long before he could contest he would be assassinated by vested interests.  To SC Bridge, vested interests meant his own interests.  But Cream was a champion and killing him would be a waste; this was what made SC Bridge sorrowful. 

“You have been operating without clearance?”  The SC demanded.

“Not without clearance, Commander.  I have operated well within the AuC’s guidelines.  I am to conduct spy missions in enemy territories with nil collateral damage and without special clearance for every mission.”

“You have been operating without clearance.”  The SC stated, his voice firmer this time, and the growl deeper.

AuC Cream bowed his head in silent acceptance, for the SC’s statements were not contestable.

“Was there nil collateral damage, AuC?”  The SC pierced, not asked.

“None, Commander.”

“Empty and Stacy made it to Edoran?”

“Yes, Commander.”

“And they have made it back?”

“Yes, Commander.”

“And have their reports ready?”

“They reported to me, Commander Bridge, and I am ready with it for you.”

SC Bridge nodded, satisfied.  AuC Cream was rash and hasty, but he was a valuable asset to have in a sixteen-man army that was supposed to be invincible if it wanted to successfully defend and protect sixteen million Ahurunians.  He would have to be questioned later about how he had thought up of sending spies into Edoran itself, but right now it was the report that interested SC Bridge the most.  

“Begin then, Cream.”

Fourteen firm claps hit the hover-set, AuCs conducting the mandatory ritual to greet a direct command from the SC to an AuC.  AuC Cream stood up and floated on his hover plank to the far end of the hover-set, directly in front of SC Bridge.  He raised his hands over his head and bowed ninety degrees, which was the ritual for the AuC receiving the direct command to conduct.  

“Not all is perfect on Edoran as the Kadorrans claim, Commander.”

“In what way?”

“For one, the Reflection itself is not pleasant business.  Nearly all the Reflecteds feel mild to severe nausea, and many report weird out of body experiences, strange visitations, godly realizations and the kind.”

“Kadorra and Vaktuki have covered this secret well.  All they report is the nausea part, and slight disorientation.”  The SC said, more to himself than to his men.

“But there is more, Commander.  A small section, but section nevertheless, of the Reflecteds claims eerily common experiences.  These people speak of alien intrusions into their minds, of an indiscriminate ransack on their memories and knowledge as they pass through the Reflectiverse.  These people are also prone to feeling sharp jabs of pain in their brains and falling unconscious for hours at end.”

AuC Cream paused, waiting for a reply from the SC.  But the latter remained silent and this meant that the AuC was to continue speaking.

“There are also many things we need to consider before establishing citizen colonies on Yulhin.  Once the Edoranians got over their initial euphoria of being the first humans to set foot on a planet outside the Thean star system, they realized that they simply missed Kadorra too much to fall in love with their new world.  The problem was the Kadorrans had got too used to the drones that served them, but the drones were made for obeying human masters, not establishing colonies.  On Edoran, the migrating Kadorrans had to do the work themselves and the hard work and sweating wearied them down.  Word of this filtered through to Kadorra, and applications for Reflecting to Edoran fell sharply.  Kadorra hides this and will deny it, but it is now paying many citizens to Reflect to Edoran.”

“But these problems arise because of Kadorran society and its ways.  What does this have to do with Ahurun and Yulhin?”  

The growl was back in SC Bridge’s voice.  AuC-SC relations were defined by many codes.  One of them was that the SC was on a need to know basis with the AuCs.  Whatever the SC did not need to know was not to be told to him.  No AuC was allowed to waste the SC’s time with news, reports, and notices etc. that were irrelevant to the matter at hand.

  AuC Cream’s steel voice did not falter, and he did not flinch under the glare of the SC.  “It deals with us, Commander, because we must learn from Kadorra’s mistakes, even as Vaktuki is probably making them right now.  Do we know of Yulhin’s gravity?  If it is higher than Thea’s, then the higher it is the more difficult it will be for Ahurunians to adjust to a terrain that isn’t hospitable to begin with.  And what about our own Reflection propaganda?  Do we promise Ahurunians of a better world, more opportunities or do we tell them the truth?”

SC Bridge’s eyes grew wide, his head rolled back, and he laughed out in desperate amusement.  No AuC had ever seen even a smile from the SC, and looks of shock and uncertainty about the proper ritual passed over the fifteen men, Cream included.  When his mirth subsided, the SC glared at Cream, the glare unmistaken when he lifted his visor to uncover his eyes.

“The 'truth', AuC Cream?  You wonder if we could tell the Ahurunians the 'truth'?”

It pleased Bridge to see uncertainty pass across Cream’s face.  “Er…yes, Commander.”

SC Bridge rolled his visor back down and reclined back in his seat.  He made two quick gestures and two AuCs sprang to their feet swiftly.  An SC had a unique system of silent gestures with his of his AuCs.  No AuC was to ever share his own system with another.  When SCs were not in a mood to talk, they would simply conduct a gesture that only the AuC it was indicated for would recognize.  

AuCs Ramon ‘Hole’ Thitpal and Gnad ‘Mess’ Vuhulan hovered over to behind SC Bridge.  The others could see pozoid pixels flashing on the two men’s visors.  SC Bridge made thirteen conspicuous gestures and thirteen men flashed their attention to him.  

“Would you be so kind, AuC Cream Gomnat, to tell me what you think the truth is?” 

The sixteen AuCs once again performed their rituals to be conducted following a direct command.

Some of the nerve had returned to Cream’s voice and composure.  “The truth, Commander, is that Yulhin is not a planet that can be properly colonized without great strain, stress, and loss.  Reflecting Ahurunians will be leaving behind comfortable and peaceful lives to work, toil, and possibly die on a planet as far from their own as far can be.”   

SC Bridge nodded in a mockingly indulgent manner.  He eyed AuC Cream with a mixture of sympathy and amusement. 

“Cream, you cannot be closer and farther from the truth.  You are right that the planet cannot be properly colonized without great strain, but what you know as the truth ends right there.  The real truth begins after that.  Would you not like to see?”

Cream nodded, a fire burning in his eyes that all failed to notice.  His moment was about to come soon, but he needed that vital information.  AuCs Hole and Mess transmitted information pozoids to the visors of the remaining AuCs.  When the transmission was complete, all visors went blank and SC Bridge looked at Cream, eagerly.

“What do you think, Cream?”

Senior Commander Ufunlat ‘Bridge’ Thaltov found out what Cream thought in the most unfortunate way possible.  From his right hand Cream threw a talitium inhibitor at the AuCs, and their Prakashic guns were rendered inactive by its force field.  Moving like no Ahurunian AuC could have, he jumped from his hover onto the hover-set, throwing a nerve ambiguator at the AuCs, who found themselves as inactive as their guns.  Leaping across the hover-set, elegant, but determined; he ran towards a man who had just now realized betrayal and was standing up in proud and confident defense.  

SC Bridge’s eyes blazed anger just before his visor turned black.  He roared in indignation and sprang to the hover-set too.  Side panels emerged out of his helmet and joined below his chin.  A thin silver film emerged out of his belt and covered his torso up to the shoulders.  But the leaping rebel AuC reached him even as he was pulling out his Prakashic gun.  In the next instant, before SC Bridge’s eyes could express shock, a drone to small too be seen by any human flew into his belly and exploded.  Cream watched with disgust the exposed viscera of his former leader lying in shreds around his feet.  

AuC Hole watched the scene in outrage and terror, unable to move due to the nerve ambiguator field.  He watched with rising hatred as Cream walked over to him, and whisper into his ear just before teleporting away.

“The Vedantins are here, my former colleague.”

#### 8

The Emperor’s Hall was a tense place.  It was an emergency meeting between the Emperor and the Regents.  Emperor Sarvaraj sat on his throne, majestic and intimidating, looking down at his three Regents- Regent Fonta Handon from Ingika, strong and intimidating in his own right; Regent Riuten Glamot from Ditana, grim and expressionless; and Regent Tripey Estans from Ahurun, disconsolate and agitated. 

“Both the Kadorrans and Vaktukans are denying any involvement,” said Regent Riuten in his even, calm voice.

“They’re lying.”  Said Regent Tripey emphatically.



The Emperor eyed Tripey sympathetically.  SC Bridge had been the main man in Ahurun, and he did all the real work.  With Bridge abruptly assassinated, Tripey found himself thrown in the midst with no real knowledge of what to do and how to do it.  

“It’s not as simple as that, Estans.”  The Emperor said grimly.  “Neither Kadorra nor Vaktuki have any real motive to kill Bridge.  They do not stand to gain from his death.”

“How can they not, Emperor?”  Challenged Tripey, “Bridge has been the Senior Commander for thirty years!  He was the invincible head of the invincible army, which was to make the first Ahurunian foray through the Reflectiverse.”

“But you forget, my Regent, that Karuntak Karunik is too reluctant in matters containing violence.  And Kinan Retrapi is single-mindedly obsessed with Daevonakri.”

Tripey shook his head furiously, “not valid enough, Emperor.  Karuntak Karunik is a cunning and shrewd old campaigner, and Kinan Retrapi is capable enough of multi tasking even when appearing obsessed.”

The Emperor put his hands in the air, “What would you have me do, Tripey?”

“Imperial Investigation,” Tripey said plainly, “nothing short of that.”

The Emperor shook his head, “that cannot be done, Tripey.  Vaktuki’s submission to the Empire is reluctant and resentful.  I cannot afford alienating them.”

“And what of Kadorra?”

“Perhaps, but even then we will need to be cautious.  Offending Kadorra would mean disaffecting the devoted all over Thea.”

“But do you not see the importance of this, Emperor?”  Tripey roared, “Someone assassinated my Senior Commander, the protector of sixteen million Ahurunians!”

“He can be replaced,” interrupted Regent Fonta.

Tripey shot Fonta a look of fierce ire, “this is none of your business, Fonta.”

The Emperor struck his fist on the throne-rest.  “Enough!  I will not have my Regents squabbling with each other.”

The sight of the formidable Emperor looking like that was enough to douse any anger the Regents were feeling.  It was widely rumored that Thean Emperors, right from the time of the first- Emperor Prathma, possessed the power to break wills and manipulate emotions, which is what helped them keep the throne within their dynasty.  Emperor Prathma was a benevolent and just ruler, and even the Tritha brothers had accepted him without complaint.  Prathma’s son, Daevorat, had united all of Thea under one Empire when he conquered Kadorra and Ahurun and added them to his territory.  But the line after Daevorat’s son Yudhanath was incapable and corrupt.  Long periods of the Empire went by squashing and holding back rebellions all over Thea.  Emperor Sarvaraj’s great-grandfather, Emperor Tatvadaev established a rule almost as mighty as Prathma’s and reconsolidated the Empire.  By the time Sarvaraj, the twenty-second Emperor in the line, came to the throne, he had for him an Empire that had accepted the power of the Emperor, either willingly or reluctantly.  

“But, my Emperor,” said Riuten, his voice unchanged by the Emperor’s demeanor, “this is not just about Ahurun.  It is about the rising audacity of the rebel regions.  It is a direct attack on the Union of Regencies, which is your most loyal ally.”

“Exactly!”  Agreed Tripey, “today it was Ahurun, tomorrow it could be Ditana or Ingika.  How long will we let them take liberties?”

“Only as long as I feel that the liberties are tolerable.  Let me tell you plainly, Tripey, that I agree with Fonta’s view that your SC can be replaced.  I am not going to confront the rebel regions in these changing times for a matter as simple as the assassination of one man.  I cannot order an Imperial Investigation, but rest assured that I will have this matter probed comprehensively and the culprits brought to my feet.”

“If we find conclusive evidence of Kadorran or Vaktukan hand?”

“Then I will find that the liberties are not tolerable anymore.”

* * * * 

AuC Ramon ‘Hole’ Thitpal became the first man in the history of Ahurun to rise to the position of Senior Commander without going through the selection process.  Within twenty-four hours of Bridge’s death, the AuCs had assumed control of Ahurunian politics and administration, and in one sweep changed the entire map of the AuC.  The unnecessary and outdated rituals were done away with, and so was the selection process.  Thirteen AuCs unanimously voted for AuC Hole to lead them, and so it was that he became the reluctant leader of the world’s only invincible army.   

“No searches yield satisfactory results, Commander.”  Informed AuC Mess.  “The word ‘Vedantin’ isn’t found in the database of any region.  A total blank…”

“What would you say, Cactus?  Do you think that the assassination is connected with the Reflectiverse expansions?”

Cactus was AuC Shabhri ‘Cactus’ Inja, one of the AuC’s most experienced soldiers.  “It’s tough to comment on that.  The Regent is convinced that the two matters are connected, and he suspects Kadorra.  But on my part, I think the assassin wouldn’t have bothered with telling us who he was if he was from Kadorra or Vaktuki.  If they are the culprits, they would only avoid getting their names involved; why create some new group?”

“Interesting observation, Cactus.  But it could be a trick to distract us and divert attention.  Personally, I think that it is below Kadorra to do something like this, but Vaktuki is a different matter.  Have Empty and Stacy been questioned?”

“We have them under investigative arrest but they seem clean,” informed Mess.  “Both say they didn’t notice any change in Cream’s behaviour and I don’t think they suspected anything.  They were as ignorant as we were.”

“Have we checked his communication records?”

“All scanned repeatedly, boss,” replied AuC Tymat ‘Rooms’ Bergholm.  “The only calls he made to Kadorra or Edoran were to Empty and Stacy; they show no evidence of conspiracy.  There were no calls made to Vaktuki or anywhere else on Thea.”

SC Hole sighed.  “The Regent gets more and more impatient, boys.  He wants fast results, though I suspect he just wants evidence against Kadorra or Vaktuki.”

“And what of the Reflection due in three days?”  Asked Cactus.

“That proceeds as planned.  We will be flying to the Imperial Sector in Ingika, from where we’ll be reflected to Yulhin.  I have AuCs Juice and Seal working on arranging the supplies and instruments together.  Speaking of AuCs, do you have the AuC directory ready for me, Mess?”

“Ready, Commander.  Should I transmit it to you?”

“Yes.”

Both Hole and Mess turned their visors down.  Mess transmitted the information pozoids to Hole.  On his visor’s internal screen, Hole saw the names and bios of his AuCs appear one by one.

SC Hole pressed a button on his wrist pad and the visor screen went blank.  He turned to AuC Mess.  “Quite satisfactory, Mess.”

“Thank you, Commander.”

There was silence for a while, then Mess began tentatively, “Hole?”

“Yes, Mess?”

“Cream knows the plan now.  Whoever he is working for will also know by now.  Do we still go ahead with it?”

“I see no reason not to.  There are no rules or Imperial Guidelines that prohibit us from doing what we are going to do.  Yes, the other regions will cry foul, and they will protest, but Ahurun will not be stopped.”

“And if Vaktuki decides to reciprocate?”

“Then let it.  There is enough space for both regions to expand without ever coming into conflict.”

“But Vaktuki will forever prepare for one.”

“And so will we.”

* * * *



Contact Shaper Lek’Hrinn wrinkled his nose in disgust.  Human bodies were frail and fetid, and he was happy to get rid of Cream’s body as he shape-shifted back to his own.  Cream’s arms receded into his shoulders and three tentacles appeared on either side.  Lek felt some pain as Cream’s legs merged together to form one, thick, supporting limb.  Lek’s torso turned from skinny to slimy and grew stocky, strong, and leathery.  His neck disappeared and the torso connected straight to Cream’s head, which was now turning back into Lek’s.  The ears withdrew inside his skull and Cream’s long, round face shriveled and became wrinkly.  Dozens of reddish blue tentacles emerged out of Lek’s face, giving the impression of hair and a beard.  The nose became barely visible flat slits just above Lek’s mandibles and inside his mouth the tongue became another tentacle and recoiled far back inside his stomach.  A pale green color spread around Cream’s eyes as they grew smaller and withdrew further inside Lek’s face.  Lek felt his internal organs changing from human to Vedantin.  For a few moments, the human heart inside him stopped pumping as it made the transition to Vedantin heart, during which Lek felt the toxic oxygen emanating from his pores.  His right tentacles groped within his coriaceous torso and pulled out the wizened human lungs.  He cast them away with disdain.  As his senses began reorienting to their original body, he felt the superior vision and hearing seep back into him.  He saw, with delight, Cream’s fragile sex organ grow into his own thicker and powerful organ and the testicles retire inside his body.  When the shape-shifting was complete, Lek’s tentacles withdrew into his torso and he grimaced with pain as the Vedantin wings burst out on either side.  Light, metallic, and imposing, the wings were the product of fine Vedantin biomanipulation.  

'Next target?  'He inquired.

'Vaktuki, Kinan Retrapi.  'Replied the voice inside his head.  

Lek spread his wings in a flash, and with a swish of metal against the air, he was airborne.  He was Contact Shaper Lek’Hrinn, one of the four Vedantin Fliers, and arguably the best.  As the sickening Thean wind blew across his body, he felt the immense power of his species, which was here to civilize the barbaric humans; and he was to be the harbinger of that change.

In one year Edoran had been colonized, two million of Kadorra’s thirteen million humans had settled on it.  The Central Plains, where the first Kadorran team had appeared, became the hub of Edoran.  Four levitators provided residence to more than half of the Edoranian populace, with the other half choosing to live near the forests, mountains, or the ocean according to personal choice.  Succeeding teams had found vast fields beyond the northern mountains that had been converted into farms growing palty, waroj, and rabaz; the chief grains.  The western forests had been found to hold fruits that were remarkably like Thean mangoes and apples.  Edoranian tourist brochures advertised the fruits as more delicious than even the renowned Ingikan ones.   

The eastern ocean spread all over Edoran’s eastern hemisphere and its delta came all the way up to the west of the western forests, separated only by once dry river beds.  These beds were now used to carry the ocean waters over to the northern farms, supported by an intricate tunnel network that passed below the northern mountains.  Towards the south, just about the Great Ridges, lay the Edoranian Administrative Levitator.  Supplemented by Yaktukan technology, the levitator was unlike any on Thea in that it could float all the way up to the residential levitators if needed, although the need hadn’t arrived yet.  The EAL was also the 2nd largest levitator known to man, the largest being the Imperial Levitator in Ingika.  Kadorra-like transport tunnels connected the levitators to each other and went up to the northern farms, western forests, and the eastern ocean.  

This ocean, which was named the Inthyuka Ocean by Edoranians, teemed with various species of varying sizes.  A few of them were larger than the largest Edoranian ships, but these larger species were to be found in the deeper regions of the ocean, where the Edoranian fishing ships did not venture.  The fish of this ocean were sent back to Kadorra, from where they were transported to the Imperial sectors in Ingika and Ditana.  These fishes were a delicacy among the Imperial personnel.  The western forests were home to five identified species of birds, and the largest of them, named the Edavian, soared higher than the reaches of the EAL.  Further south of the Great Ridges and further north of the northern farms were vast tracts of inhabited and unexplored land.  

Ananuk Vikratik, the Edoranian Administrator, would have been more than happy with the situation if he wasn’t plagued by Reflection-related troubles.  

“Triarka, you are the only one who can help me here.”  He pleaded, for what he felt was the umpteenth time.

“What help can I give you, Ananuk?  Each time I have entered the Reflectiverse and emerged out I have told you what I have felt, and each time I have been as confused and as unnerved as always.  You may try to brush this under a talitium sheet but sooner or later people will find out, and they will clamor for your head.”

“But there must be a reason why some are more affected than the others!  Why can I not experience the same sensations that you do?”

Triarka shrugged, “this is why I insist that I am in fact of no help, Ananuk.  You say you value my opinion and judgment nevertheless, but you chose to ignore it.  I tell you, again, that there is something seriously wrong with the Reflectiverse.  I can be dramatic and hasty and say that it is inhabited by a bizarre species of aliens, but I will not go that far, yet.  But neither you nor Karunik in Kadorra can pretend that the intrusions many of the Reflecteds feels are delusions or harmless side-effects.  There is a tangible and perceptible presence of ‘something else’ within the Reflectiverse.”

Ananuk sighed heavily.  Things would have been easier if one by one major leaders on Thea had not been assassinated by their own trusted aides.  The first to go had been SC Ufunlat Thaltov of Ahurun.  He had been followed by Kinan Retrapi, who was assassinated by none other than Utaril Tripun.  The Ditanian Regent, Riuten Glamot, had been killed by his personal guard.  But the most shocking and unsettling of all had been the murder of Admiyogi Faolvay Yuan by none other than Rabik.  In all the cases the culprits had disappeared, never to be seen again.  The Reflectiverse aided expansion had continued unhampered, but it was now done amidst suspicion, rivalry, and secrecy.  Ananuk did not know how things were on Daevonakri, Yulhin, Ingika II, and Lokarna; the colonies of the other regions.  Emperor Sarvaraj, to his credit, kept efforts up to reconcile the regions to at least cooperate in their expansion; but with the list of murders growing everyday, and no sign of the culprits, suspicion and wariness among regions were only getting stronger.  On top of all this he had the unenviable task of convincing the affected Reflecteds to keep their experiences to themselves.  But not a day passed by without some report somewhere on the Kadorran-Edoranian InterWire about the mysterious alien intrusions into the minds of some of the Reflecteds.  

Now, amidst all of this, he had been approached by the SC Ramon Thitpal of Ahurun, requested a meeting with the AuC.  It would have been a tactical error to invite the AuC to Edoran itself, so Ananuk had to Reflect back to Kadorra.  For him the Reflection had never been as Triarka and others like him described.  The mild disorientation and nausea he had felt the first few times had vanished, and only a temporarily increased heart beat rate followed his Reflections.  

The AuC was a dour and sullen bunch.  Ananuk had heard of some of them through the Thean InterWire- Ramon, Oldenki, Othrank, Gnad, and Elorathna.  He knew that there were sixteen of them in total, including the SC, Ramon.  After the recent assassinations no one had pursued the perpetrators more assiduously than the AuC, and when he thought of the fact that the AuC now wanted to talk to him, he couldn’t help but remember how he felt when Admiyogi Faolvay had first contacted him, when what today felt like years ago.   

“I’ll keep it simple and straight, Administrator,” began the SC Ramon, in a tone of measured impatience.  “We need permission to enter Edoran.”

It took time for Ananuk to fully comprehend what Ramon was saying.  “You mean you want us to grant permission to non-Kadorrans?”

“It can mean a lot of things.  It can mean that we will be the first Ahurunians to set foot on Edoranian soil.  It can also mean that Kadorra and Ahurun are working on something together.  Many may feel that it is a sign of changing times.  I do not care for all that.  We simply want you to grant us permission.”

“I must ask, SC; why?”

“That is a matter of Ahurunian Intelligence, and it cannot be shared.”

Ananuk smiled, “you must be a very optimistic man, SC Ramon, if you think that we would grant you permission on such vague grounds.”

“On the contrary, they are very legitimate grounds.  A fellow region of the Empire asks you to aid in its investigations regarding internal security.  You are obliged to help us, Administrator.”

“Fair enough, but you are equally obliged to share with us some information regarding the nature of your investigation.  Moreover, these are special circumstances.  No region allows another to set foot on its colonies.  I am quite certain that Yulhin is out of bounds for us, no matter what the circumstances.”

SC Hole remained silent for a while; then he gestured to two of his AuCs.  AuCs Elorathna and Tymat got up and pulled out silencers from their robes.  They went to opposite corners of the room and attached the silencers to the hatches.  The silencers lit up and thin, blue plasma emerged from them that covered the entire inner walling.  It flickered for a while and then faded out.  Elorathna and Tymat returned to their seats.

“As you can see, Administrator, this room is now sound shielded.  No sound can enter or exit this room.  What I’m about to tell you is more secret than you can imagine.  Neither Regent Estans nor the Emperor possess knowledge of this.”

Ananuk bent towards the table and placed his hands on it, fingers interlocked.  “A gesture that I will most appreciate, SC.  Knowing what you are up to will help me gain faith in you.”

“When ex-AuC Rafiyal ‘Cream’ Gomnat rendered us immobile with his device, our senses remained in full control.  We could see, hear, and eventually even smell, what was going on in front of us.  After assassinating SC Bridge, he proceeded to walk up to me and whisper- ‘The Vedantins are here, my former colleague.’”

Ananuk raised his eyebrows in confusion, “Vedantins?”

SC Hole nodded.  “Yes, I can see that the name is unfamiliar to you as well.”

“Very much so, I’ve never heard of it.”

“Neither had we, but for us that was the one and only lead we had into the case.  Cream had hidden his tracks very well, and we could uncover nothing that could give us some headway; except the word ‘Vedantin.’  Given that we had precious little to go with, and we were thrown into quite suspicious times, the AuC decided not to share this piece of information with the Regent, and resultantly the Emperor.  But over the past one year we have been searching high and low for clues that could lead us closer to these Vedantins, whoever they are.”

“And have you made any progress?”

“To be honest with you, Administrator, we haven’t really.  But we have uncovered a vital fact.”

“And what is that?”

“The Vedantins are not human.”

Ananuk’s eyebrows shot up again, this time in a mix of confusion and fear.  “Not human?”

“Yes, the Vedantins are an alien species that have intruded our world, Administrator.  I would not be making such a tall claim had we not deduced this after painstaking investigation and research.”

“Can you share any of the results with me, SC Ramon?”

Ramon gestured again and AuC Elorathna carried a communo-helmet over to Ananuk.  She helped him put it on and returned to his seat.  The helmet’s visor was an internal communication screen, with a panel on the left for interface.  Ananuk recalled that this was the famed pozoid technology device of the Ahurunians.  Pozoids were invented by the Ahurunian scientist Lohinthad Blevaky more than two centuries ago, in the time of the Emperor Vanarastya, son of Tatvadaev.  Lohinthad had devised a method to reduce all available knowledge about desired categories within single display milli-chips on a visor screen.  The side panels of his visor were wired to the human brain, and it would decipher from the brain wavelengths the selected chip the user wanted to access.  In later modifications Lohinthad added communication algorithms that allowed different users to exchange and share the chips with each other.  Before he died, his last modification was to make the chips totally electronic by locating their information in packets of aether.  These packets he named pozoids, and that was the last word he uttered before he died. 

Millions of pozoids loading up on his visor screen made Ananuk dizzy; his disoriented senses caught flashes of familiar images after they were long loaded and gone.  He felt the micron wires penetrating through his skin and making their synaptic links.  The screen abruptly went blank, and he heard Hole’s voice inside his head.

'Can you hear me well?'

''Ananuk’s trained mind told him that he could reply by thought, 'quite well.  What do you have to show me?'

'Some images, and some data. '

''A single pozoid enlarged onto Ananuk’s screen.  It was a low-resolution, hazy image of a winged creature.

'This image was taken using a gigacapturer, 'said Ramon.'   We caught him on the Ingikan coast from out Island outposts.  This image was taken less than forty eight hours after SC Bridge’s assassination, and when we received it we did not take the two things to be connected.'

''The image vanished and another pozoid enlarged.  This one was of another winged creature.  The image was much clearer and Ananuk could make out the metallic sheen to the wings.  He could also sense the leathery skin of the creature.

'This one, 'began Ramon, 'was what first stirred our suspicions.  It was taken near the Vaktukan dry lands twelve hours after the assassination of Kinan Retrapi.  Two times was more than enough reason for us to be suspicious, and we tightened our watch over the leaders of other regions.  Barely a few months ago, two hours after Admiyogi Faolvay was assassinated, we caught this video through our aerial spy drone network over the Gir Mountain Range.  '

''Ananuk’s breathing surged as he saw Rabik appear onto the screen.  Robes tattered, skin scarred and singed, Rabik made his way up a steep cliff, the jagged rocks cutting into his hands as he held onto them for support.  Yet, there was no sign of pain on Rabik’s face.  He wore a calm expression, eyes almost glinting with malicious pleasure.  Rabik climbed until he reached a flat clearing, where he stopped to regain his breath.  Then he stood straight and closed his eyes.  For a while nothing happened, and then Ananuk noticed that Rabik’s arms were shrinking.  He watched in horror as the arms disappeared and gangly tentacles emerged from Rabik’s shoulders.  Ananuk watched with rising nausea as Rabik underwent monstrous transformations until he couldn’t be called Rabik anymore.  He saw a hideous, repelling creature on his screen, and he recoiled in repulsion as the creature pulled out its own lungs and cast them away.  The last thing Ananuk remembered before passing out was getting the glint of metal as the wings burst out from the creature.

All of Daevonakri was celebrating.  It had been one Thean year exactly since Kinan Retrapi and his team first set foot on the planet.  An eye watching the planet would not realize anything was up unless it proceeded to search beneath the surface, where the cities and towns of Daevonakri were located.  The capital city, New Vaktuka, lay on a northern island of the planet, accessible only by air or sea.  The skies from the mainland plains to the coasts of New Vaktuka were littered by aerials flying their way to the epicenter of the celebrations.  In one of these aerials, Daevonakri’s Reflection Regulator, Frohath Kilatri, was already done with most of his celebrations, and he lay unconscious from overdose of the hallucinogenic herb raoma.  As his automated aerial carried him to New Vaktuka, his alter ego awoke.

It sensed its surroundings and discerned immediately that it was in the personal carrier of its host.  It had been following the recent events closely, and knew that there was to be a big celebration at the hub of this planet.  But Subentity DN-FK, and that was its name, vibrated itself into concentrating at the matter at hand, or tendril.  The Controlentity had made it clear; they were to begin the first offensive into the foreign world, and Subentity DN-FK was to carry out the leading charge, which was to be at Daevonakri.  It vibrated in fear as it recalled the commanding vibrations of the Controlentity, which was growing stronger with each new Entity that was added to the Mesh.  Millions had already been banished to the lower levels of the void, never to be vibrated with again.  DN-FK shuddered in silent terror; it did not desire to be banished to those vibrationless levels, where life was only a distant memory.  But should it fail here, at Daevonakri, it would most certainly face banishment.  DN-FK sent a silent prayer to the Primalentities, and extended its tendrils across.

It sensed thousands of its kin floating; no doubt awakening after their inebriated hosts had fallen unconscious.  But they were commoners, irrelevant in the grand plans of its kind.  Some of them would be secret backups, to take over in case DN-FK was to fail.  It ran its tendrils through the texture of the vibrations, keeping a look out for the targeted vibration.  It was looking for the human who controlled Daevonakri’s defenses.  To the Entities that man was known simply as GR.  The Controlentity’s directives were unambiguous: locate GR and his dormant Subentity DN-GR; subdue GR and awaken DN-GR; enable DN-GR to access control of the GR body; use the body to organize and carry out invasive forays into Edoranian space.

“Damn it, Abhaalya!”  Geraldhi exclaimed in exasperation, “let the people of Daevonakri be blinded if that is for the best, but how can you fail to see the gravity of the situation?”

Abhaalya Retrapi, Commander-in-Chief of Daevonakri, did not let Geraldhi’s restless state reflect on her own demeanor. She took a relishing puff off her viso-cig and reclined in her chair.

Geraldhi eyed the viso-cig warily, “you should quit that, you know.”

“Why?”

“Need I really tell you?”

“Actually no, but not because I already know why, but because its really pointless.”

“What is?”

“Trying to understand the stance people like you take on the viso-cig.  It’s not like we are inhaling actual poison into our lungs like in the times of the Tritha brothers.  The viso-cig is a convenient and harmless device that stimulates your brain in the same way a cigarette would, except without the harmful effects.”

Military Commander Geraldhi Rehnali loved a good debate more than anything else.  For him it was the best way to get one’s mind off things, debating with a worthy opponent.  He found working with Abhaalya easy because she had the calm, patient, and perceptive deportment to his erratic, hasty, but often brilliant personality.  They had had this debate many times before, and each times their lines were the same.  But both enjoyed each other’s company, and when it came to the issue of protecting and running Daevonakri, neither trusted anyone more than the other.  

“Except without 'those 'harmful effects, Abhaalya;” Geraldhi countered, “that were contained in the original cigarettes.  But a device that regularly and consistently fiddles with your brain wavelengths carries dangerous and unpredictable effects of its own.”

“Unsubstantiated claims,” Abhaalya said calmly.  “It is a mildly plausible and highly tempting notion to say that there could be psychological side-effects to the use of a viso-cig, but two centuries of mass usage and two decades of vigorous research have yielded nothing conclusive.  Yet we have people like you who seem to have a vendetta against smokers.”

Geraldhi fidgeted in his seat agitatedly, “but isn’t it such a stupid thing to do, Abhaalya, given that you admit yourself that it is somewhat possible that there are real side-effects to smoking?  The two decades of research so far has been aimed at understanding the addictive aspect of viso-cigs specifically, not their entire neurosomatic facets.  Most of the research in the latter direction has been vehemently opposed by viso lobbies both in the Imperial Council and the Vaktukan Governant.”

Abhaalya smiled indulgently.  Rumors had spread back to even Vaktuki that the Commander-in-Chief and her Military aide were more than just professionally related.  Many had made a lot out of the discreet glances the two gave each other on public appearances, or of the fact that they traveled in the same private vehicle of the Commanding Convoy.  But the truth, which most of the other Commanding aides knew, was that Abhaalya and Geraldhi could never be romantically attracted to each other.  Geraldhi, a veteran with more than seventy years of service behind him, was exactly what the romantically dysfunctional Abhaalya needed in a man- intellectually stimulating.  In that sense they were as close as partners as the two of them could get.  But there was a stronger affinity which came from the fact that they were Vaktukan seniors who had seen the last rebellion against the Empire and survived it.  Off the countless seniors who were alive when the Reflectiverse was discovered, only four had made it to Daevonakri.  And now, two of them sat at the head of the planet.  Both cherished the fact that in each other they could share the memories of both- youngsters fighting in the rebellion, and old-timers making a journey that none from their generation had ever imagined.
