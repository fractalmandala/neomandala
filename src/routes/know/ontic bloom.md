The Ontic Bloom, or *ucchvas* is a term I use for the neural recalibration that is possible through engagement with Sanskrit dhātus. Sanskrit is a language characterized by 'ontological onomatopoeia,' a trait where a word/sound meaning is as close as possible to what it describes. An example of this is the name Bhṛgu. In Hindu tradition, Bhṛgu is a primal mahaṛṣi, and in the Ṛgveda he is credited as having introduced Agni to the Āryas. In other places, Svāyambhuva Manu tasks him with teaching the yajña to all mānavas. 

The word is formed this way:
√bhṛ + g = bhṛg
bhṛg + u = bhṛgu

(the prefix of √ indicates the word to be a Pāṇinian dhātu.)

√bhṛ is described by Pāṇini as bharaṇa- bearing, supporting, nourishing. And the word bhṛg is used to describe the crackling sound of fire. 

Quite a coincidence, is it not, that the root word behind Bhṛgu- the one who introduced the fire- itself refers to a characteristic of fire? Except that this is not a coincidence, this is an example of Sanskrit's ontological onomatopoeia. The suffix of -u in Sanskrit words usually denotes *for the establishment of* or *for the support of* . For example, dhātu itself means for the establishment of *dhā,* where dhā means 'to hold.' In the case of dhātus, it is to hold meaning itself. A dhātu is for the establishment of meaning. 

##### Similarly, bhṛgu is for the establishment of bhṛg

And bhṛg is the cackling sound fire makes, so Bhṛgu is for the establishment of fire. This lines up neatly with Bhṛgu's lore- the one who introduced the fire. 

With this understood, we could now reassess our understanding of several Sanskrit words. Take the case of Manu- *man + u,* where √man means knowing, thinking, mental processing. 

It should be clear now why the 'first man' is referred to as Manu!

Go ahead, try this with other words that come to mind. Here's another ramp- the suffix of *tṛ* or *tra/ṭra* refers to 'an instrument' or 'facilitator' of something. 

An instrument of mind? Mantra.
An instrument of body? Tantra.
An instrument of control/binding? Yantra.
An instrument of rule/rāja? Rāṣṭra. 
An instrument of teaching/śās? Śāstra. 

Welcome to the Ontic Bloom.
