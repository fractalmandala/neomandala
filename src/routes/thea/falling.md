Emperor Sarvadeo, the 33rd Emperor in the line of Thean Emperors, sat on a throne given to decay. For 2100 years before him, his forefathers, leaders of the ancient tribe Akin, slowly brought all the six nations of Thea under one rule. Their capital was always in the nation of Inglika, the throne resting in Tatradeorra, the Imperial mega metropolitan hub. Igmandeo, the 5th Emperor, brought the nations of Yaktuki, Ahurun, and Kadorra under Imperial authority; and then Arihandeo, the 12th Emperor, brought Vaktuki and Ditana under control too. Later historians would chronicle the period between the 12th and 25th Emperors as a period of Imperial progress and glory, but decline had set in by the time Sarvadeo’s grandfather came to reign. Now, during his reign and for the first time in almost 800 years, the nation of Vaktuki threatened to finally rebel and overthrow the Empire and Sarvadeo felt himself hopelessly weak at putting it down.

His immediate problems were direr. From Yaktuki, he had received reports of super humans being detected; from Ahurun the emancipation movement was only getting stronger; and just now he had received report that a Quantafactory had actually fallen in Ditana.

“What did you say?”  The incredulous voice of Sarvadeo echoed in his gigantic Imperial hall.

“I beg your pardon, Emperor. A Quantafactory has fallen to the ground in northern Ditana.”  Repeated Ardash Huka, the chief supervisor of Ditanian Quantafactories.

“When and how did this happen, Ardash. Tell me the whole story.”

The Quantafactories were the pride of the Empire, and indeed all of Thea. Beginning over a millennia ago as simple but productive industrial hubs, they had evolved as the nucleus of all industrial output on the planet. Each Quantafactory covered hundreds of miles of area, and there were over twenty such all over in Ditana. Four hundred years ago, Thea had discovered levitation technology, and now the Quantafactories levitated many feet above the ground in all their gigantic size.

“Approximately forty two minutes ago, I received a report from my subordinate in north Ditana saying that Quantafactory 23 had dipped briefly by a few millimetres. As you know, Emperor, that itself is impossibly rare- it has never happened before. When the scientists in Kadorra discovered the principles of levitation, they were transferred to Ditana under the rules of Imperial contract. We used indigenous technology to magnify both the capacity and the reliability of levitation. So while Kadorra still levitates only a few residential hubs, we levitate all our Quantafactories. Such has been the reliability of our technology, Emperor, that never has a single Quantafactory’s levitation faltered by a fraction of a second or millimetre. The report I received was historically unprecedented, and I immediately made my way to the Quantafactory in question.”

“You did not send me an express report.”  Sarvadeo said, only mildly accusing.

“I must admit, Emperor, that in my shock and haste I did neglect that. But at the time I knew nothing and had not surveyed the scene first hand. I thought it unwise you simply forward a report to you I received without checking it out first.”

“Fair enough, continue Ardash.”

“When I reached the Quantafactory everything was in total chaos. The technicians haven’t had to repair or check anything in the automated control systems for years. Most of the leading levitation specialists have either retired or are working for the Empire in Tatradeorra. The technician that was available hadn’t actually visited a Quantafactory since his training seven years ago. Simply put, Sir, there was no one there to take matters under control.”

“I assume,” interrupted Sarvadeo, “that you did just that.”

Ardash nodded. “I did indeed, Emperor. I first made an emergency call to the Imperial research hub in Tatradeorra, and contacted the levitation specialists. They were transported to the Quantafactory within fifteen minutes. After only a preliminary inspection they found out that someone had polluted the substance that fuels the levitation. There were massive amounts of toxic solvents in the fuel tanks, the tubes that transported the fuel, and finally on the levitation thrusters.”

Inside his head, Sarvadeo felt an urgent sensation of panic and unease. Outside, he acted calm. “So this was a deliberate act?”

Ardash nodded gravely. “I’m afraid that is the only logical conclusion we can draw, Sir. Such a pollutant couldn’t enter our fuel supplies by accident- it’s not even used in any of the Quantafactories’ process and production lines. It’s found only in some farm technologies in Yaktuki and used for some kinetic thrusters in the customized aerials produced by south Ditanian entrepreneurs.”

Hundreds of speculations whirled inside Sarvadeo’s already paranoid and taxed head. Could it be a conspiracy by Vaktuki?  Could it be the terrorist groups that fight for emancipation of Ahurun?  Could it be a new enemy?  Tied maybe with the weird reports from Yaktuki?

“How did the fall happen?”  He asked.

“Once the specialists detected the pollutant, I ordered the evacuation of the skeleton crew that worked at the Quantafactory. They said that once the pollutant reached the main thrusters anything could happen, although an altogether shut down of levitation systems was unlikely because of the backup controls. Still, I asked transport controls in Ditana to shut down the tunnels that passed beneath the Quantafactory, and ordered a nationwide inspection of fuel lines in all the Quantafactories. Leaving the specialists to continue with their inspections, I headed here to report this to you in person. No sooner had I left that I got a call from a transport patrol that was near the Quantafactory. He said that the whole complex had fallen weightless to the ground; rumbles were felt as far down as the river Primia south. I turned my aerial around to see this for myself, and I cannot convey to you the full image of destruction, Sir. Hundreds of squares of miles of debris, half broken half operating clunks of machinery, fiery explosions and blazes in dozens of areas, not to mention the immense smoke and toxic fumes that are forming a giant cloud even as I speak.”

Sarvadeo was reeling in shock. The planet-wide rumours of an Empire in decline and a weak Emperor hadn’t missed him, he was painfully aware that his persona was but a pale leftover from the once glorious aura of the Deos, his family line and rulers of Thea. 

“I will have to inspect this for myself too, Ardash. But tell me, have you heard from the other Quantafactories?”  If Ardash were a sharp fellow, he may have noticed the slight quiver that had entered the Emperor’s even voice.

Ardash’s shoulders slumped, and he took a deep breath- as if to deliver the final blow. “I’m afraid I have, Emperor. The reports keep coming in. So far seventeen Quantafactories have confirmed the detection of the pollutant. They could fall anytime. I have the best people working on a detoxifying solution but I’m already too late for many of these.”

  “Does the Ditanian Prime Minister know of this?  Why hasn’t he contacted me yet?”

“One of my subordinates reported to him, Sir. Sadly, he had a heart attack when heard of this is now in the hospital. We must hurry, Sir, a Quantafactory can fall any moment, and I need not tell you of the immense damages the fall of single one has already created. Our production of basic starch syrup has gone down by seventy percent, by tomorrow there will be shortages in Vaktuki, Kadorra, and Yaktuki. If the Quantafactories producing steel and kinetic fuels fall, it could be the breakdown of planet-wide economy.”

Sarvadeo nodded, for a moment his jawline a sharp image of his forefathers. “You continue this from your end, Ardash. Find out how to stop this and how to control the damages. I will unleash a massive campaign to find out who is behind this. The offenders will not get away from me, not from the Empire.”

Ardash, comforted by the confident words of his beloved Emperor, bowed in polite deference and left. His simple heart beating in silent horror at the implications of what had fallen upon them. Sarvadeo, 33rd Emperor in the line of Emperors of Thea, gave himself a few moments of private introspection. Ardash’s grim predictions were accurately on the mark, and captured only a small part of the larger crisis that would unleash with the fall of the Quantafactories. The Vaktukan industries were always waiting to break through the market monopoly of the Quantafactories, and emancipation movements of Ahurun had tied these industrial behemoths to their protests against Imperialist capitalism. Once the product shortages reached Vaktuki and Inglika- the most populous nations- the social ramifications would result in the breakdown of the Empire. Sarvadeo had followed Ardash’s career closely, and he had no doubt the man would find a way to prevent the fuel pollution. What the Emperor needed, what the Emperor now craved, was to find the culprit. And for this he would turn to another young man who career he had not only followed, but nurtured and facilitated. Arkan Vidant- the Kadorran born commander of his Imperial military forces in Vaktuki and Kadorra.

Even from outer space, its beauty was breathtaking. Thea hung in the cosmos like a green-brown marble and its landlocked seas glistened under Aon’s starlight, like fresh fruit in spring. Metallic, electrical, and binallic structures orbited it like bees around their comb. Terracrafts and warcruisers acted as bays for the hundreds of civilian ships and airbolts flying back and forth from the planetary surface. At any given time, it was estimated that 2 million of Thea’s 60 billion people were in orbit around the planet.

Arkan Vidant approached his home planet in a solitary airbolt back from a patrol mission to Inglika, Thea’s nearest neighbour in the Aonic star system. At his plane of approach Aon’s disk haloed Thea’s globe almost concentrically, and between them Arkan knew lay the twin planets of Vaktuki and Yaktuki- the Empire’s military and agricultural bases respectively. He scrambled his airbolt’s identification code to the approaching bolt station and the security shields relaxed. He flew past the station’s binallic receptor and let his airbolt off to autopilot. Binallic thrusters overtook the propulsion and his craft, 'the Dirty Player, 'slowly soared into orbit around Thea. The twenty nine year old punched in his codes and the airbolt’s rejuvenation foam sprayed out, wrapping him in a comfortable bubble of healing. Nanopins pumped relaxants directly into the muscles of his chiseled face, instantly loosening his cheeks and jaw- hollow from years of smoking. Velvet soft pressure nodes pressed into his head and temple, gently squeezing out tension points. Laser razors shaved off every milimeter of facial hair, including his goatee- military personnel had to crop their hair and shave before landing into their warcruisers after missions. The foam’s artificial secretion glands dropped vision realignment liquid into his dark brown eyes, readjusting his sight to Thea’s orbital panorama. 

At the corner of his airbolt’s communication panel a flashing infodget warned him of an urgent incoming message. “Kit,” he muffled through the foam and immediately his perceptual kit’s binal nodes pushed through the foam and attached themselves to his forehead. The marvelous, present-time vision of Thea vanished and the worried and somber face of Emperor Sarvadeo expanded inside his mental sight screen. 

10th Emperor of the Thean Empire, Sarvadeo was the nephew of the last king, and opponents often pointed out that he wasn’t exactly the rightful heir to the Deo throne. It didn’t matter that the fifty two year old Emperor was a just and smart ruler. And unlike previous emperors, Sarvadeo liked to maintain a more direct interference in the workings of his empire. 

Ensconced inside the rejuvenating foam of his airbolt, Arkan could barely move. “Emperor!  I wasn’t expecting this, as you can see,” Arkan said, not reading Sarvadeo’s grave expression. At fifty two, Sarvadeo was a picture of health and physique. Daily regimentation procedures and advanced sculpting stages re-toned and rejuvenated his body. The Imperial barber, a non-sentient drone, trimmed his hair down to just the right length on regular intervals. These were only part of the many processes the Emperor underwent to maintain his physical aura of a ruler- from the grand line of the Deos no less. The Emperor’s paraphernalia were absent now though, and Arkan saw only the light of Aon shine brightly through a panel behind Sarvadeo, obscuring his vision of the Emperor’s surroundings.    

Sarvadeo didn’t indulge in banter. “I have a mission for you Arkan, patrol.”

“Now?”  Arkan asked. “But I just got back!”

The relationship between the Deos and the Vidants went back many centuries. The Vidants were one of the wealthiest residents of Kadorra, Thea’s cultural metropolis. In 7200, the then emperor Igmandeo II was gifted the knowledge of binallic technology by the Vidants’ research corporation, marking the beginning of binallic overlapping of Thean technology. Sarvadeo was barely stepping into emperorship when Arkan had been born, and the crown prince had attended the young Vidant’s naming ceremony.

“I understand that, and I’ll have your mother to answer for this. But something’s come up, Arkan. I need you to fly to Ditana and conduct a situational analysis.”

Already punching in the navigation codes, Arkan replied, “why, what’s happened?”  

“The Quantafactories have been attacked.”

***

The planet of Ditana was colonized in 7090, by the same colonist forces that set humanity’s first foot on an alien surface in 7070- under the leadership of Vaktuki and Yaktuki Tritha. Vaktuki died four years later, pushing his younger twin into madness and exile. That would have marked the planet’s neglect and decline right there, but for the historic Imperial-Trithan Meet in 7101 between then emperor Arihandeo and Yaktuki Tritha. It set in motion the plans for Ditana’s industrialization- that was the advent of the Quantafactories.

Ditana was the 6th and last colonized planet from Aon, but the largest Quantafactories were visible even as one approached orbit around Ahurun, the 5th planet. Their long, gangly towers stretched far out from the lower end of Ditana’s sphere. Aon’s light here was sparse and dim, and Icham’s Gas Belt between Inglika and Ahurun lent it a faint, violet hue. It was part of every Thean pilot’s final exam to navigate his or her way through Icham’s Gas Belt- the filament like cloud of gas and ions that ran through the Aonic star system between Inglika and Ahurun. Arkan had navigated his way through it more times than he cared to remember, but the marvel never ceased. Ion charged clouds inside the belt cast tarpaulin like sheets of electricity, rendering chartered navigation routes useless. Gas clouds bounced Aon’s light back and forth among themselves, each cloud lending its own hue to the now iridescent star light. Exit from the belt into the star system was like being flung into a black curtain, only that the impossibly large, frighteningly disorienting globe of Ahurun would appear almost instantly. Only a prior dosing of vision realignment fluid allowed the pilot to pick up star configurations and reorient his position before resuming his original course. 

That was of course, enough for a pilot to face without having the additional knowledge that the Empire’s marvel, its greatest feat of industrial and mechanical engineering, was crumbling. Every aspect of Arkan’s education had contained some information about the Quantafactories. You couldn’t learn about interstellar flight maneuvering without learning about the gyrobinallic levitators at the Quantafactories. You couldn’t learn weapons and defence without knowing about their highly automated and complex defence network- one that extended over the entire planet of Ditana. Even grasping the fundamentals of in-flight rejuvenation and healing was impossible without a case study of the Quantafactories’ semi-bionic cleansing systems. Besides that, binallic technology had been invented in Kadorra under the funding of the Vidant family. Arkan’s home education itself had consisted of history lessons of the Quantafactories. Through the numb shock of knowing that something horrible had happened to the Quantafactories, the history lessons came reeling back to Arkan as his airbolt sped on towards Ditana.  

Binallic technology had been invented in year 7200, the culmination of over a century’s work of modification and revision of the many technologies and scientific discoveries the Tritha Twins had left behind- Bionic Nodal-Artificial Intelligence. The means to directly interface the human mind with any technology it conceived. Humanity had found control over its creations like never before. In an instant an entire industry built around the creation of androids and robots was brought to bankruptcy. Who needed a robot when one could turn on the television with a thought?  Who needed an android servant when an online purchase order was an instant away?  But those who invested their money in such things had more money to invest, and soon binal research was the richest field- professors became terraforming merchants within decades. Within another century the binallic and the perceptual kit industries collided, the end of media and entertainment corporations. Everything you ever wanted to know, everything you ever wanted to see or fantasize was available on a mental screen inside your head in the form of data packets called infodgets. Doctors modified the kits to build surgery and diagnosis aids, military campaigners adapted them to create a complete and versatile war weapon. Pilots began to fly their crafts not with their hands and feet but their minds. 

Of course, all of this began almost half a century 'after 'Yaktuki Tritha signed a treaty with Emperor Arihandeo designating Ditana as the industrial planet of the Empire. So when the technicians and engineers of Ditana were introduced to binallic technology, projects that had been limited by technical constraints became possible. Overnight the planet went from being a place of sweat and toil to a place of thought and creation. Engineers commanded giant constructors into building magnificent temples of industry and production. Layer after complex layer of metal and polymers were added to create ever growing industrial supercomplexes. The technicians began fashioning themselves as artists. It stopped remaining a matter of efficient production alone; it became a matter of 'aesthetically 'efficient production. And surely, the aesthetic principles were guided by the Trithan Command- the only challenge ever thrown up to the religious and ritualistic authority of Vidadorak, Thea’s single largest religion. In 7356 a local technician, now calling himself a thinker, completed his magnum opus- the largest industrial complex man had ever seen, a Quantafactory. He gave up his designs to the common perceptual corpus and hackers and builders across Ditana had access to infodgets containing the instructions to build Quantafactories of their own. The rest was a matter of bureaucratic machinery. The Empire realized that Quantafactories were the course of the future, and devoted much of its binallic research to Quantafactory R&D. By 7412 the Quantafactories had become institutionalized.

By 7442, Arkan added to himself with a smirk, the Quantafactories had begun to see their demise. Still at a distance from Ditanian orbit, he could already see large swathes of fire sticking out like glowing embers on a carpet of night. Even in the devastation the glint of metal combined with these embers to form a grim picture of beauty. Already outraged, Arkan sped his airbolt on, eager to enter atmosphere and inspect it more closely. It had all happened so quickly, Sarvadeo had told him. Some ‘artist’ had detected an anomaly while surveying his creation and went in for a personal check. He found that his Quantafactory’s levitation fuel tanks had been injected with a pollutant. He immediately sent out a message to all Quantafactories. By the time the last Quantafactory’s fuel lines were found polluted, the first one had already begun its surrendered-to-gravity descent to the Ditanian surface. 

Among their many marvels the Quantafactories levitated many thousands of feet above the surface, allowing the residents to build them in all three dimensions. This levitation was almost the only thing in the Quantafactories that wasn’t binallic, the human mind wasn’t capable of sustaining levitation of masses as large as the Quantafactories (a problem which, if solved, would have had interesting implications for space flight). The pollutant immediately sent the levitation systems into emergency shutdown mode- something which was normally done 'after 'the Quantafactory was brought back to the surface through controlled deceleration. The result was that tons and tons of metal, polymers, electrical links, and binallic generators fell crashing back down.

It was a scene of unimaginable destruction that Arkan witnessed only when he broke into the atmosphere. Many miles above it he had only seen the taller of the towers beginning their slow lean towards the ground, and the occasional fumes of a large thermal cloud. On a normal day, he would have had to dock his airbolt on a bolt station in orbit and take a gyrothruster pod to a Quantafactory levitating nearby. Today there were none, and the Ditanian atmosphere was entirely clear except for the components and shards of the larger towers that were now reentering the airspace like an angry rain of fire. It reminded Arkan of the Vidadorak couplets, essential teachings of the Vidan religion. And when Prakadora need display its power, one of the couplets went; fireballs from the sky will be its messenger. Seeing the endless pile of blazing debris below him being battered by its own fireballed cousins, Arkan could easily imagine Prakadora raining its vengeance upon Ditana- a gruesome and real rendition of the philosophical battle between the Trithan Command and Vidadorak. His own, neutral heart went out to the Trithan Ditanians, followers of the Command to the letter. Was this indeed a display of Prakadoran power?

He spotted a few Ditanians waving to him from a rejuvenation capsule down on the surface and switched to hover mode. The airbolt’s sleek, long wings receded into its main frame and levitation thrusters jutted out from below. Arkan instantly felt the pressure of gravity, or rather anti-gravity. Ditana had gravity almost one point three times that of Thea, explaining the more than usual stress on his airbolt’s thrusters. He pressed a hatch button and easily slid out of the craft, his binal suit’s gravitic alligners immediately slowing the descent. He skillfully guided himself towards the capsule, landing smoothly only a few meters away. 

There were two men and a boy of about ten inside the capsule, all wearing binal suits and waiting for him with hands on their hips. When he stepped in the older looking one of them stepped forward and extended his hand. “Welcome, pilot!”  He said, strikingly at ease despite the picture of destruction around him. “Quite the sight, eh?”  He gestured to the scenes outside. 

“Er, yeah,” Arkan replied hesitantly, still not understanding the man’s amazing composure. The other companions looked on, but the child was clearly playing a game inside his perceptikit. “You guys have any identification codes?”  Arkan asked.

Infodgets appeared in the corner of his kit’s visual screen. He mapped them inside and a mental screen expanded, showing the details of the capsule’s three occupants. The older one was Bach Sorma, chief artist and owner of one of the Quantafactories. The other one was Ormach Sorma, his younger brother. The child was Tituva, Bach’s son. Merely to be polite, Arkan relayed his own information back.

Bach’s eyes instantly lit up in recognition. “A Vidant!  We’re honoured.”  He and his companions stepped back in a mild bow. 

“Please,” Arkan held his hands up in protest. “I’m here as a pilot and soldier of the Imperial defence forces, a reconnaissance mission sent directly by the Emperor. Please call me Pilot, or Arkan even.”  

Bach smiled in understanding, and Tituva gestured in muffled exultation- he was obviously playing a game. “I understand, Pilot Vidant,” Bach said.

It’s almost as if the Vidant name is a fervent prayer, Arkan silently to himself. Outwards, he said, “so, what do we know about what happened?”

“Sabotage!”  Ormach said instantly, and Bach gave him a look that Arkan could not read.

“Well, there was sabotage involved,” explained Bach. “But what you see around us is merely Prakadora giving yet another sign of its malevolence.” 

“Oh yes,” interrupted Ormach. “Tell him about how this is the result of a scheming deity. Tell him everything he needs to know who did this to us.”  The sarcasm in Ormach’s voice was unmistakable, and Arkan wondered what conflict lay beneath this overt sibling rivalry. Bach gave his brother a mildly intimidating look but Ormach went on. “Pilot, here are the facts. Someone or some power deliberately injected pollutant into our levitation fuel lines. Across the planet, in every single Quantafactory. The result you can see for yourself. It’s going to take months, maybe years before we rebuild the industrial complex of Ditana. For now, Thea and Inglika will have to supply their own demand.”  The scorn in Ormach’s voice was very perceivable. Thea and Inglika were the residential and commercial planets of the Thean Empire. To the technicians of Ditana they were bastions of the spoilt and pampered elite. 

“Very well put,” agreed Bach, “But also very narrow. Find the saboteur, Pilot. Subject him to the full justice of Imperial law. But what will you achieve?  This event is the mark of something new, something disturbing.”

Ormach scoffed, and Tituva was now listening intently. Arkan pressed, “What are you talking about?”

“The Trithan Command!”  Bach exclaimed, almost indignant at having to explain. “When your devices come crumbling down, know that Prakadora comes for blood!" These are the lines of Vaktuki Tritha, immortalized in his Command!”

Ormach would have interrupted, but Arkan pressed on. “You’re talking about Icham’s Second Coming?”

“The Resurrection, yes!”  Replied Bach, getting increasingly animated. “Prakadora returns!  And its followers will find that their God is not so benign after all!”

***

The Quenoan Void Dwarf, the Quenoan Galaxies Larger and Minor, the Mitaar Galaxy, and Forma Unaar; all had been conquered. Their/Its Empire extended from Quenoa Larger, beyond the Great Void Wall, right up to the spiral end of Quenoa Minor. Taken as a plane ellipse, the Empire was over sixty million light years across. But still short, still a negligible fragment of this vast universe. So much left to conquer, the great filaments of the sky still far and unreachable. That would, of course, stay predominant on Their/Its mind. But now after many millennia of routine expansion a stirring had occurred. 

'What was its name, that species it had eliminated so far back in memory?' They/It could not recall, but the pleasure of genocide still struck a gratifying cord. 'Well, not genocide really. For some of them had survived, had they not?  Yes, their scout ship at the edge of Their/Its Empire, ignorant of its detection had verified that.' It had been piloted by their kind- so they were alive. A small nuisance, but a nuisance nevertheless. And what of their armies?  Those irritating immortals They/It had warped into the River of Aether?

> Ah, the River of Aether…
> Genesis, source Mother, Slave.

Would it be that the Genesis was in trouble?  'No, it cannot be. Or could it?'  They/It decided that the risk was not worth taking. This is how the stirring began.

Take the universe, spread it out on a piece of paper. Now place a drop of ink. The ink and the paper are lovers. Verily the ink spread outs, devouring as much of its lover as it can. But it encounters a wall, something it does not understand. Place a line here, draw waves over it to mark conflict. This is the Great Void Wall, and the ink conquered it. The ink spread on, and thus it comes to settle for a while- its lust temporarily satiated. Place a dot here, this is the galaxy Quenoa Larger- and of its nature even the paper trembles. But lust rises again, and the ink reawakens. The Wall, that unconquerable beast it bested, it wants that flesh again. So it retraces its steps, the Wall now a recreation- or so they say. It returns to its origin, reminds itself of the love it holds for this paper, its entire body. Mark this origin as the Quenoan Void Dwarf galaxy. The ink moves on to hunt new erogenous zones, new locations on the paper’s skin where it can rake its salacious hands. It finds another spot- this is the galaxy Forma Unaar. Mark many waves here, for here happened a conflict greater than the universe has seen. But the ink’s carnality is great, and it wishes to devour more. It’s stretched too thin it finds, it needs more of itself.

A message comes from its appendage in the south, a new source (has the ink become a hive?). Mark it; mark it for this is where our story will play out- the galaxy River of Aether. The ink feasts here and grows stronger, but then recedes- verily it returns to Forma Unaar. New power guides it, a strange new confidence. Many years later, observers and victims alike will call it the Bubble. And thus the ink spreads on, but it despairs for it can never feast on the entire paper- so vast the subject. Mark another place, a place where despair was so great that the ink considered stopping, it considered giving up. This is the galaxy Mitaar, a place of great sorrow and pilgrimage. This is where the ink returns when its spirit is weak, when the paper seems simply too large. But sympathize not for this ink, for its nature is lust- and the paper is endlessly the subject. 'When I finally have feasted on all the paper,' the ink thinks, 'I will have lived.'  Remember this when you judge the ink.

Again it spreads the ink now stubborn in its belief. It finds a spot so profoundly sensual, so concupiscent in its invite. Draw a circle around here, for if the story takes you there, all the ink’s pleasures will be yours. This is the galaxy Quenoa Minor, and the ink wishes this was its origin. Take a moment to observe all that you have marked; it is but a speck on the paper. And yet draw a quadrant around this speck, the ink is called God in the entire quadrant- so great its quest, so epitomic its love for the paper.

They/It and Their/Its species are the ink, the paper is the universe as established. Their/Its name is Praka, and they are the most powerful and expansive species the universe has ever seen, true successors to their genetic precursors- the Kador. Now the humans of Thea and the ancient Kador are related in more ways than one, but that’s another story. The Praka are nothing like their forefathers, a psycho-physiology so markedly different that when the Kador’s other successors encountered the Prakas, they were marked 'alien'. There are three humanoids in our story. The humans are one of them, the Prakas are not. But let us get back to the ink story, something interesting happens there- as it does in ours.

The ink is now husband. None has conquered the paper as much- none deserves that title but the ink. So why does it worry?  Because every thrust is powered by something, every prurient expanse propelled by an engine. That engine, just outside the pleasure region of its southern appendage, now stirs in trouble. The ink must protect it, for how will the paper be swallowed?  Remember that spot you marked where our story will play out, the River of Aether?  Go back there and attach another label- the Engine, or Genesis, or Source Mother- anything, but mark it as highly important because the ink surely has. It needs to recharge, in fact it needs to increase the power of Source Mother itself. Verily the ink returns to the River of Aether and this is indeed the stirring, for it has been unimaginably long since the ink has ventured outside the Bubble.

A game of reduction, reduce They/It to It.

Name it Icham.

The Infinity of Simple Death.

Icham stirs…

More often than not when Icham stirs it thinks of its greatest rival, the only entity in the known universe that challenged it, perhaps even frightened it momentarily- Vau, Eternal of Death and Destruction. But Vau died millennia ago on his homeworld, crushed under the assault of Icham’s forces. Icham takes time to remember why it stirred, the ancient but powerful mind makes a check of systems. 

First and foremost, Vau. But he’s dead.

Second, the resource breeders. The Prakas- an asexual species that 'produces' its kind in factories, fuelling the five galaxy wide expansion. Resource breeders are working fine.

Third, the Relative Frame. It keeps the Empire locked in absolute space. Observers and victims alike call it the Bubble. The Bubble is stable and unwavering.

Fourth, the competitors. The remaining nine Infinities- equal in power but inferior in repute. They stir as it does. 

And last but most important, Genesis. Ah, Genesis. It worships Genesis, second only to the forefathers Ar and Ur. Genesis that fuels the Bubble. Genesis that provides momentary quenches of its thirst for the universe. Ah-

The Universe. Long ago it had wondered what life meant. Some answers came from the ancient texts of its forefathers. Many more came from Ar and Ur when They were found. But none were satisfactory. To know life, one had to conquer life. One had to become life. It had decided the first of its prime directives:

'To know something, I/We must become It.'

In those times it had conducted the first of its exploratory researches, for to become It, it had to define It. 'Is that It, 'it had asked. 'Not, not This. 'Moving on, 'is that It?'  'No, not this.'  Wider and wider it expanded its perspective, but everywhere the answer was the same- Not This. Wider, until it reached the limits of its perception- the Universe. The metaphorical paper.

To know the universe, it must become the universe.

Genesis fuelled that quest, so what of Genesis- this was the last but most important of its system checks.

Genesis was under risk. Antak!

It remembered that name finally. Antak was the name of the kind it drove to near genocide. Antak was the name of the kind whose Eternal of Death and Destruction was Vau. Antak was the best realization the universe had ever offered of its fears of failure. Antak had returned, Antak had been detected again. And Antak would head for Genesis. For Source Mother.
