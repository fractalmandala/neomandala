On the planet Thea, there are six nations.  One of them is Yaktuki.  In Yaktuki, there are many vast fields of farmlands.  Along one such farmland there are small huts and shacks lined.  In one of these huts sit three men on a table, looking at each other.  One of them has beard and hair clearly uncut for years, the second is taking nervous puffs of his viso-cig and staring at the others waiting for them to speak, the third is silently sitting and looking at the man with the beard.

“Took a lot of hard work getting you to come out.”  The Beard man comments.

“Hard work!  That’s an underestimation, pal!”  Exclaims the Viso-cig man.  He points animatedly at the silent man, “when this guy goes underground, he doesn’t kid around!”

The Silent man gives Beard man the hint of a smile.  Beard man frowns.

“The rules were very clear,” Beard man states, “you are to remain accessible at all times.”

“I’ll tell you what’s accessible,” begins Viso-cig man, “accessible are the highest mountains in the Peaks of Tritha, accessible are the western coasts of Ahurun, but not this guy.”

Beard man looks at Silent man, waiting for a response.  In the dimly lit shack Beard man can only barely see Silent man’s face.  His cheeks are cragged and scarred and there is an old, weary look in the eyes.  His hair is neat though and Silent man carries no beard or moustache.

Viso-cig man looks at Silent man in half admiration-half resentment.  “Just because the Twins aren’t around anymore doesn’t mean you do what you fancy, buddy naki.”

Beard man nods.  “Kerastuk is right, we still live by certain rules.  And there still is the Trithan Command, or have you forgotten that?”

Silent man smiles to reveal a perfect set of teeth.  “Just because I chose to forget you fellows, doesn’t mean I forget the Twins, Amloh.  The Trithan Command is between me and my maker.”

Amloh plays with the strands of his beard.  “Unfortunately, Triarka, it is not between you and your maker.  In choosing to live in this world you are agreeing to abide by a code of discipline set down for Vaunakin on foreign land.  If you cannot do that, your rights can be revoked.”

Triarka looks at Kerastuk, who continues to smoke his viso-cig.  Kerastuk was only a young soldier when Triarka and Amloh were Vaunaki commanders.  On the western mountains of Ahurun, now called the Peaks of Death, Triarka had saved Kerastuk’s life many times over.  Yet a few hours ago it was Kerastuk who managed to capture and arrest Triarka, bringing him before his old Vaunakin colleague Amloh.

Triarka was an absconding Vaunaki- meaning he had disconnected from the bond that connected all Vaunaki on Thea.  In return he was to report to the Vaunaki leaders whenever called upon.  Triarka had missed the calls for the last few decades and had finally been captured.  When Yaktuki Tritha migrated to Yaktuki, his Vaunaki army stayed back for reasons that are so far only best explained by the Vaunakini, an esoteric Thean text.  Triarka however chose to go with Yaktuki, and thus had to disconnect from the bond.  The remaining Vaunakin stayed back in southern Kadorra, and over the centuries integrated themselves as humans.  

After Yaktuki’s death Triarka became a local farmer, adopting the land much like his master had.  To the outside world Triarka was now a respected farmer and a most ingenuous inventor.  To the two Vaunakin in front of him right now, he was once the deadliest Vaunaki in the Trithan army.

“You look nervous, Kerastuk.”  Triarka notes.

Kerastuk chuckles and powers down his viso-cig.  “Don’t flatter yourself old naki.  I’m the one who just captured you, didn’t I?”

Triarka nods, “you most certainly did, and you have full right to be proud of yourself.”  Then he looks at Amloh, his old colleague.

“So what now, Amloh?  I am to be taken back to the council for justice?  Or will I be sent off Thea itself?”

Amloh sadly shakes his head.  “What has been your problem, Triarka?  We once fought and killed together.  Together you and I knelt before the Trithas and pledged never ending loyalty to the Vau blood in them.  Why did you have to turn against us?”

“I have never been against you, Amloh.  I have never been against any of my brothers.”  Triarka replies.  At that Kerastuk snickers and Amloh gives him a sharp look.  “Well, never directly at least.  Now if you send Vaunaki soldiers after me, trying to capture me, then you can’t expect me to just sit and let them do their job, do you?”

Amloh takes a deep breath and rests his hands on the table, leaning forward closer to Triarka.  “I’m tired of this, Triarka.  The Vaunaki council told me not to let our old friendship come in the way of dealing with you, I request that you do not make their job easier.  Come, let us talk as friends?”

“I would be most pleased, but I want this child out of here.”

Kerastuk gets up in outrage and Amlohi with him.  He puts one hand on Kerastuk’s shoulder, restraining him.

“He’s just trying to play with you, Kerastuk,” Amloh says, “you’ve caught him and words are all he has to throw at you.  Please leave us to talk alone.”

Kerastuk shrugs Amloh’s hand off his shoulder and walks out.  Triarka gives Amloh another white, wide smile.  “Awful trouble you go to, to make this one happy,” comments Triarka.

“We always have.  He’s a very capable and powerful Vaunaki, you know that.”  Replies Amloh.

Triarka nods, “I know very well, but I wonder if that’s the sort of Vaunaki we ought to keep off Thea, not retired old farmers.”

Amloh chuckles in spite of himself.  “Perhaps you’re right, old friend.  But that’s for another world another place.  Here, I need you to give me answers.”

“Answers to what?”

“Why you stopped reporting back to the council, for one.”

“Because since Yaktuki died has any Vaunaki ever been able to truly retire?  You, Amloh, were successfully retired for close to four hundred years.  Your farms were not too far from here.  Then the council ‘calls for your services’ again and you had to go back.  Now look at you, trying to appease an immature Vaunaki soldier while trying to capture one of the deadliest alive.”

At that Amloh chuckled again.  “Deadliest alive?  You do flatter yourself, Triarka.”

“At least it’s only myself I flatter, Amloh,” Triarka replies sadly.

“So what do want of me, Triarka?  Are we now to rebel against the Vaunakin council?  Are we to change the way the Vaunaki have functioned for thousands of years?  Thea cannot be an exception even if things have been different here.”

“Why not?  Why, if everything else has been different on Thea, does this have to be the same?  The Vedantins are free, each living his life as he pleases.  Their king, Pritha, calls of them no more.  Neither does our master, Vau.  Why then do we still need a council?”

“What you’re saying would get a Vaunaki beheaded, Triarka.”

“And that’s why I chose to run away and hide, instead of saying this in front of the council.”

“You can’t do that anymore.”

“Why not?”

“I won’t let you.”

More almost two millennia ago, Triarka and Amloh had set foot on Thea together.  Previously, they had conquered seven worlds for Vau, their master and the Eternal God of Death and Destruction.  Vau had many brothers, each with their own army or naki.  Thus the army of the death god Vau was called Vaunaki.  Together, they were taken in by the beautiful contrasts of this new land.  The river Igmand curved gracefully around the Ahurunian plains, almost like it was cutting out the mountains’ territory for them.  In and out it weaved through the foothills, teasing the mountains to come closer to the plains.  And yet, within and beneath those mountains lay savage tribes of barbaric and belligerent nature.  Triarka fought battles more vicious than on any world before.  The mountain tribes were savages but they fought with such precision and coordination that it was a sight to watch.  The warrior in the Vaunakin heart thanked Vau for sending them such challenging opponents, and fell in love with Vaktuki for leading it against them.  In his heart, Triarka had truly loved Vaktuki even more than Vau, a thing unheard of among the nakis.  

“But I’m a simple farmer, Amloh,” Triarka reasons, “what danger do I pose to the council?”

“You don’t but the precedent you set poses a serious danger to us all, Triarka.  Imagine what would happen if Vaunaki like Kerastuk decided to cut loose like you?  If we had so much trouble capturing a benign Vaunaki like you how much trouble could an arrogant and belligerent one cause?”

“So you need me because you need someone to set the example.”

Amloh shakes his head in the negative.  “Now you’re being deliberately difficult.  In choosing to be the exception you are choosing to be the example, Triarka.  There is no escaping that.  In any case what are you really fighting against?  This is how it would be back with Vau too, wouldn’t it?”

Triarka sighs in exasperation, his shoulders slumping.  “But we are not back with Vau, Amloh.  We haven’t heard from Vau in centuries.  The last order he gave to us was to follow his sons.  After that Vau has forgotten us.  So for the first time in millennia the Vaunaki are actually free.  And what do we choose to do?  Capture a pocket of land on this planet and then play our council and bondment games.”

“Better than farming!”  Retorts Amloh.

“If a Vedantin can do it, why not a Vaunaki.”  Triarka’s reply is faint and hesitant.

Amloh chuckles again, and a pleasant look enters his eyes.  “Come now, Triarka.  You and I were once the highest ranking commanders in the Vaunakin army.  We personally conquered three worlds for our master.  Surely our end is not to be idle and meaningless like this,” he points to the dim shack around them and continues, “let me make you a deal.  If you allow us to connect you to the bond again, then I’m sure I can talk the council into granting you a full pardon.”

Triarka frowns.  “Amloh, in the many centuries I have known you, I have never known you to be impatient.  You can fence for hours and not get tired with your quarry.”

Amloh shrugs, “So?”

“So what makes you impatient now?  The normal you would sit and talk for hours, maybe even talk of our old war stories to warm me up.  On the other hand you easily send Kerastuk away and go straight to the point.”

A wry smile comes upon Amloh’s face.  “Times are changing again, my old friend.  I need voices among the Vaunaki that have reason and sway.  As a returning rebel you will have both.”

Triarka puts on a fake expression of shock.  “Amloh!  You will use me as a pawn in your schemes to overthrow the council?”

Amloh pretends to hit Triarka and the latter pretends to evade.  The two share in laughter for a while before subsiding into an expectant silence.

“Triarka, did you hear of the Quantafactory fall in Ditana?”

Triarka nods, “some of my traders told me about it.  It’s obviously quite serious.”

“Not as serious as you think.  Triarka, I have reason to believe it was done by the Vedantin.”

This time the shock on Triarka’s face is real.  “Vedantin!  That is impossible and you know it as well as I do.”

“I will show you the evidence I have if you promise to return with me, Triarka.  But trust me my evidence is good.  Then I need you to help me convince the council.”

When Vau created his army, he called upon its commanders and gave his doctrine.  ‘You are all my sons,’ he had said to them.  ‘And thus unto each other you are a brother.’  This doctrine was exemplified more in practice among the Vaunaki than among any battling force in the known worlds.  Each Vaunaki was a brother unto another and trust was consummate.  It is said that in battle one Vaunaki could battle blindfolded with his brother guiding him by voice, and yet they would kill enough for two seeing Vaunakis.  

On the world before Thea, Triarka and Amloh were once stuck in a dangerous position.  A large battalion of the Vaunaki had been decimated by the natives’ giant monstrous hounds while a backup force on the other side of the battle fields had simple disappeared in a dust cloud.  Triarka’s personal contingent was guarding the vessels that carried them from Vau’s world while Amloh’s personal continent guarded the two commanders, Triarka’s right arm broken.  The two were cornered into a valley surrounded by mountains from three sides, and the dust clouds approached from the open side.  Knowing that his contingent wouldn’t survive, Amloh sent it out to look for survivors and carry them back to the vessels.  Triarka and Amloh were left to face whatever the dust cloud carried.  In that moment Triarka pulled out the eye shields that Vau had personally given to him.  Given by Vau himself, the shields worked only on the receiver and were useless to any other.  So in that cornered valley on a foreign world, Triarka and Amloh enacted the fable that was used to glorify Vaunakin brotherhood.  A shielded but wounded Triarka barked instructions at Amloh who cut down the enemy soldiers that came with the dust clouds.  Barking and cutting down they had survived till Amloh’s contingent had come back to look for them.

“Amloh,” began Triarka, “a Vedantin doing anything to harm a human is unthinkable.  It is equally unthinkable that a follower of the Trithas would make such a claim.”

“You think I don’t know that?  Yet I make this claim, but still I dare make it only to you, my closest and oldest friend.”

“A captive you got using a younger and more able Vaunakin.”

“Stop trying to soft stab me, Triarka.  I need you in with me on this.  If you help me, I promise I will help you against the council.”

“Oh so we’re overthrowing the council too, after all?”

“If it comes to that.”

“But I’m a simple farmer, Amloh!”
