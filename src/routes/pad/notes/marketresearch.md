I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have real-time access to the internet or any databases. My knowledge cut-off is as of September 2021, and I can't retrieve or provide real-time data or updates. Therefore, I can't conduct active research or provide specific, up-to-date figures for your request.

However, I can provide some general information based on my last update. 

Step 1:
As of 2021, the online video content market in India was rapidly growing, with predictions suggesting it could reach several billion dollars in value by 2023. Major media players include international platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ Hotstar, as well as Indian platforms like Zee5, SonyLIV, ALTBalaji, and Voot.

Step 2:
The major platforms for video content as of 2021 were YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, and Instagram (IGTV). There were also Indian platforms like Zee5, SonyLIV, and Voot. The content split varies greatly between them, with YouTube hosting a vast range of user-generated content, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video focusing on professional series and films, and IGTV focusing on short-form content.

Step 3:
Some of the biggest independent content creators in India as of 2021 included Bhuvan Bam (BB Ki Vines), Amit Bhadana, and Ashish Chanchlani. Their subscriber bases were in the millions. On average, these creators could get hundreds of thousands to millions of views per video, and the average video duration often ranged from 10 to 20 minutes.

Step 4:
The revenue earned by content creators can vary widely depending on the platform, their number of views, their specific agreement with the platform (if any), and the revenue they generate from other sources such as sponsorships and merchandise. On YouTube, for instance, revenue is typically earned through ads, channel memberships, YouTube Premium revenue, Super Chat, and YouTube's merchandise shelf. As of my last update, it was reported that YouTubers could earn between $0.25 and $4 per 1,000 video views after YouTube takes its cut.

Step 5:
As an AI, I don't gather data in the traditional sense. My knowledge base is constructed from a broad range of sources and is updated by developers periodically, the last of which occurred in September 2021.

Step 6:
In sharing all of this data, please note that it's based on my last update in September 2021 and may no longer accurately reflect the current state of the online video content market in India. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend conducting active research using recent data from trustworthy sources.

Step 1: According to recent estimates, the online video content market in India was worth approximately $270 million (INR 2,000 Crore) in FY 2020-21, registering a growth rate of around 89% from FY 2019-20. Major media players operating in this space include Reliance Jio, Disney, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar, Voot, Zee5, Alt Balaji, and Eros Now. These companies offer both ad-supported and subscription-based streaming services. Most of these service providers have entered into strategic partnerships and collaborations with other content producers to expand their content portfolio and user base.

Step 2: YouTube remains one of the most dominant platforms for online video consumption, with over 180 million active users every month as of March 2021 according to stats from Statista. The platform competes against homegrown rivals like TikTok which has gained massive popularity among Gen Z audiences due to its short form video content with a strong focus on music, comedy, dance, and visual effects. Other significant players include Facebook Watch, SonyLiv, and Sun NXT, where content primarily comes from movie studios and TV broadcasters. Platform distribution still varies by niche genre but Hindi language content dominates while English lags behind to target non-Hindi speaking communities in India. Nevertheless, social influencer Vidooly claims that "since late last year [2021], thereâ€™s been a growth trend in the creation of English content, which signals growing interest."

For viewership statistics, here is some further insight provided by Ipsos and Sterlite Tech "74 percent of Indians watch web-series daily on platforms such as Dhruv, Inside Edge, Mind Hunter while nearly 9 out of 10 young millennials tune in weekly". Interestingly, user behavior shifts drastically towards using mobile devices or PC-laptops compared to traditional cable access - YouTube and broadcast catch-up solutions quickly rise. To measure precise time splits per session among the viewers or consumers, we know that the attention span gradually decreased for each age group from 2019 through 2020 according to SimilarWeb with approx 37 minutes on YouTube videos falling from nearly 44 mins

What are the most effective strategies for monetizing online video content in India?

There are several effective strategies for monetizing online video content in India. Here are some of the most popular ones:

Advertising revenue: Advertising is the most common way to monetize online video content in India. Content creators can earn money by displaying ads before, during, or after their videos. They can do this by partnering with ad networks like Google AdSense, which will display relevant ads to their viewers and pay the creator a percentage of the revenue generated.

Brand sponsorships: Another popular strategy is to collaborate with brands and promote their products or services in their videos. This can be done through product placements, sponsored videos, or brand integrations. The content creator can charge a fee for this type of partnership, which can vary depending on the size of their audience and the brand they are working with.

Subscription-based model: Some platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video use a subscription-based model, where users pay a monthly fee to access their content. Content creators can also use this model by creating premium content that is only available to subscribers. This can be a good option for content creators with a loyal fan base that is willing to pay for exclusive content.

Merchandising: Another way to monetize online video content is by selling merchandise like t-shirts, mugs, or other products related to the content creator's brand. This can be a good option for creators with a strong and engaged fan base who are willing to purchase branded merchandise.

Crowdfunding:Crowdfunding is another option for content creators in India to monetize their video content. They can use platforms like Kickstarter or Patreon to raise funds from their audience. This can be a good option for creators who want to produce higher-quality content but don't have the budget to do so. By offering their viewers exclusive rewards and perks for their contributions, creators can build a closer relationship with their audience and generate revenue at the same time.

Overall, the most effective strategy for monetizing online video content in India depends on the content creator's goals, audience, and type of content. By experimenting with different monetization strategies and analyzing the results, content creators can determine which methods work best for them.
