Design is the first entry in this index. I've done it so because design is core to everything that brings me here. Long before I heard of 'design thinking,' the meta actions preceding actions always fascinated me. 

I understand design as both- the method, preparation, arrangement that goes into a deliberated action, and the process in which said action is played out.   My design journey started near 2010/11, when I picked up Photoshop. These days my tool of choice is Figma.

But I rarely think of design in terms of 'graphic design.'More than most things, it's the design of information and data structuring that I enjoy.  I am strongly of the opinion that design and art are different things, not just in what they produce but also in the very intent preceding them. And that makes all the difference.
