deposit of quotes I've liked and/or learned from over the years...

> The only true philosophical question is whether to commit suicide or not.
<small>Albert Camus</small>

> The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed.
<small>Buckminster Fuller</small>

> The human mind, in its progress, marches knowledge to knowledge, renews and enlarges previous knowledge- often obscured or overlaid, seizes on old imperfect clues and is led by them to new discoveries.
<small>Shri Aurobindo</small>

> The central purpose of a history must, therefore, be to investigate and unfold the values which age after age have inspired the inhabitants of a country to develop their collective will and to express it through the manifold activities of their life. Such a history of India is still to be written.
<small>Shri KM Munshi</small>
